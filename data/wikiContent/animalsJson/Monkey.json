    "As food": "Monkey brains are eaten as a delicacy in parts of South Asia, Africa and China. In traditional Islamic dietary laws, the eating of monkeys is forbidden. However, monkeys are sometimes eaten in parts of Africa, where they can be sold as \"bushmeat\".\n",
    "As service animals for the disabled": "Some organizations train capuchin monkeys as service animals to assist quadriplegics and other people with severe spinal cord injuries or mobility impairments. After being socialized in a human home as infants, the monkeys undergo extensive training before being placed with a disabled person. Around the house, the monkeys assist with feeding, fetching, manipulating objects, and personal care.\n",
    "Classification": "The following list shows where the various monkey families (bolded) are placed in the classification of living (extant) primates.\nORDER PRIMATES\nSuborder Strepsirrhini: lemurs, lorises, and galagos\nSuborder Haplorhini: tarsiers, monkeys, and apes\nInfraorder Tarsiiformes\nFamily Tarsiidae: tarsiers\nInfraorder Simiiformes: simians\nParvorder Platyrrhini: New World monkeys\nFamily Callitrichidae: marmosets and tamarins (42 species)\nFamily Cebidae: capuchins and squirrel monkeys (14 species)\nFamily Aotidae: night monkeys (11 species)\nFamily Pitheciidae: titis, sakis, and uakaris (41 species)\nFamily Atelidae: howler, spider, and woolly monkeys (24 species)\nParvorder Catarrhini\nSuperfamily Cercopithecoidea\nFamily Cercopithecidae: Old World monkeys (135 species)\nSuperfamily Hominoidea: apes\nFamily Hylobatidae: gibbons (\"lesser apes\") (17 species)\nFamily Hominidae: great apes including humans (7 species)\n",
    "Description": "Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight, to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb). Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).\nSome characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World monkeys have prehensile tails while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all. Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic. Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.\n",
    "Historical and modern terminology": "According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word \"monkey\" may originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published circa 1580. In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape. In English, no very clear distinction was originally made between \"ape\" and \"monkey\"; thus the 1910 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for \"ape\" notes that it is either a synonym for \"monkey\" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate. Colloquially, the terms \"monkey\" and \"ape\" are widely used interchangeably. Also, a few monkey species have the word \"ape\" in their common name, such as the Barbary ape.\nLater in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through \"monkeys\" and \"apes\" to humans. Monkeys thus constituted a \"grade\" on the path to humans and were distinguished from \"apes\".\nScientific classifications are now more often based on monophyletic groups, that is groups consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor. The New World monkeys and the Old World monkeys are each monophyletic groups, but their combination is not, since it excludes hominoids (apes and humans). Thus the term \"monkey\" no longer refers to a recognized scientific taxon. The smallest accepted taxon which contains all the monkeys is the infraorder Simiiformes, or simians. However this also contains the hominoids (apes and humans), so that monkeys are, in terms of currently recognized taxa, non-hominoid simians. Colloquially and pop-culturally, the term is ambiguous and sometimes monkey includes non-human hominoids. In addition, frequent arguments are made for a monophyletic usage of the word \"monkey\" from the perspective that usage should reflect cladistics.\nA group of monkeys may be commonly referred to as a tribe or a troop.\n",
    "In experiments": "The most common monkey species found in animal research are the grivet, the rhesus macaque, and the crab-eating macaque, which are either wild-caught or purpose-bred. They are used primarily because of their relative ease of handling, their fast reproductive cycle (compared to apes) and their psychological and physical similarity to humans. Worldwide, it is thought that between 100,000 and 200,000 non-human primates are used in research each year, 64.7% of which are Old World monkeys, and 5.5% New World monkeys. This number makes a very small fraction of all animals used in research. Between 1994 and 2004 the United States has used an average of 54,000 non-human primates, while around 10,000 non-human primates were used in the European Union in 2002.\n==== In space ====\nA number of countries have used monkeys as part of their space exploration programmes, including the United States and France. The first monkey in space was Albert II, who flew in the US-launched V-2 rocket on June 14, 1949.\n",
    "Literature": "Sun Wukong (the \"Monkey King\"), a character who figures prominently in Chinese mythology, is the protagonist in the classic comic Chinese novel Journey to the West.\nMonkeys are prevalent in numerous books, television programs, and movies. The television series Monkey and the literary characters Monsieur Eek and Curious George are all examples.\nInformally, the term \"monkey\" is often used more broadly than in scientific use and may be used to refer to apes, particularly chimpanzees, gibbons, and gorillas. Author Terry Pratchett alludes to this difference in usage in his Discworld novels, in which the Librarian of the Unseen University is an orangutan who gets very violent if referred to as a monkey. Another example is the use of Simians in Chinese poetry.\nThe winged monkeys are prominent characters in The Wizard of Oz.\n",

    "Relationship with humans": "The many species of monkey have varied relationships with humans. Some are kept as pets, others used as model organisms in laboratories or in space missions. They may be killed in monkey drives (when they threaten agriculture) or used as service animals for the disabled.\nIn some areas, some species of monkey are considered agricultural pests, and can cause extensive damage to commercial and subsistence crops. This can have important implications for the conservation of endangered species, which may be subject to persecution. In some instances farmers' perceptions of the damage may exceed the actual damage. Monkeys that have become habituated to human presence in tourist locations may also be considered pests, attacking tourists.\nIn religion and culture, the monkey often represents quick-wittedness and mischief.\n",
    "Religion and worship": "Hanuman, a prominent divine entity in Hinduism, is a human-like monkey god. He bestows courage, strength and longevity to the person who thinks about him or the god Rama.\nIn Buddhism, the monkey is an early incarnation of Buddha but may also represent trickery and ugliness. The Chinese Buddhist \"mind monkey\" metaphor refers to the unsettled, restless state of human mind. Monkey is also one of the Three Senseless Creatures, symbolizing greed, with the tiger representing anger and the deer lovesickness.\nThe Sanzaru, or three wise monkeys, are revered in Japanese folklore, together they embody the proverbial principle to \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\".\nThe Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted monkeys in their art.\nThe Tzeltal people of Mexico worshipped monkeys as incarnations of their dead ancestors.\n",
