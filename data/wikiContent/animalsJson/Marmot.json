    "History and etymology": "Marmots have been known since antiquity. Research by the French ethnologist Michel Peissel claimed the story of \"gold-digging ants\" reported by the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who lived in the fifth century BCE, was founded on the golden Himalayan marmot of the Deosai Plateau and the habit of local tribes such as the Brokpa to collect the gold dust excavated from their burrows.\nThe etymology of the term \"marmot\" is uncertain. It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning \"mountain mouse\".\nBeginning in 2010, Alaska celebrates February 2 as \"Marmot Day\", a holiday intended to observe the prevalence of marmots in that state and take the place of Groundhog Day.\n",
