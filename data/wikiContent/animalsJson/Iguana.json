    "Anatomy and physiology": "Iguanas can range from 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m) including their tail. The two species of lizard within the genus Iguana possess a dewlap, a row of spines running down their backs to their tails, and a tiny \"third eye\" on their heads. This light-sensing organ is known as the parietal eye, visible as a pale scale on the top of the head, and cannot make out details, just brightness. Behind their necks are small scales which resemble spokes, known as tuberculate scales. These scales may be a variety of colors and are not always visible from close distances. They have a large round scale on their cheeks known as a subtympanic shield.\nIguanas have keen vision and can see shapes, shadows, colors, and movement at long distances. Their visual acuity enables them to navigate through crowded forests and to locate food. They employ visual signals to communicate with other members of the same species.\nThe tympanum, the iguana's eardrum, is located above the subtympanic shield (or \"earshield\") behind each eye. Iguanas are often hard to spot, as they tend to blend into their surroundings and their coloration enable them to hide from larger predators.\nMale iguanas, like other male examples of Squamata, have two hemipenes.\n",
