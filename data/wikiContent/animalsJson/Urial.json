    "Behaviour": "The mating season begins in September. Rams (which live separately at other times) select four or five ewes, which will each give birth to a lamb after a gestation of five months.\n",
    "Distribution": "The urial is found in western central Asia from northeastern Iran and western Kazakhstan to Pakistan's Balochistan and Ladakh regions of North India. To the east it is replaced by the bigger argali and to the southwest by the Asiatic mouflon. Its habitat consists of grassy slopes below the timberline. Urials rarely move to the rocky areas of the mountains. For example, in northern Iran they produce hybrids with Asiatic mouflon under natural conditions. Urials feed mainly on grass but are able to eat leaves of trees and bushes if needed.\nThe conservation status of the urial is threatened as their habitat is perfectly suitable for human development; however the urial population has been recovering in recent years.\nThe Afghan urial found in Musakhel district in Surghar and Torghar. A 2005-2006 survey by WWF Pakistan shows 145 urials found in Surghar, Srakhowa District Musakhe. Yahay Musakhel et al. 2006)\n",
    "Physical characteristics": "Urial males have large horns, curling outwards from the top of the head turning in to end somewhere behind the head; females have shorter, compressed horns. The horns of the males may be up to 100 cm (39 in) long. The shoulder height of an adult male urial is between 80 and 90 cm (31 and 35 in).\n",
