    "Booted eagles": "Booted eagles or \"true eagles\" have feathered tarsi (lower legs).\nTribe Aquililae or proposed subfamily Aquilinae. Genera: Aquila, Hieraaetus; Spizaetus, Oroaetus, Spizastur; Nisaetus; Ictinaetus, Lophoaetus; Polemaetus; and Stephanoaetus.\nSee comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera.\n",
    "Description": "Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Aquila pennata), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (0.99 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large, hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful, having up to 3.6 times human acuity for the martial eagle, which enables them to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.\nEagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The dominant chick tends to be a female, as they are bigger than the male. The parents take no action to stop the killing.\nDue to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and Ichthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich Spizaetus genus, live predominantly in woodlands and forest. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.\nThe bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn. However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8 times heavier than the preying eagle. Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):\nThey have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous – but not the Eagles.\nAmong the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy and Philippine eagles, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats. Eagles in the genus Aquila, though found almost strictly in open country, are superlative soarers, and have relatively long wings for their size.\nThese lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide Raptors of the World in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.\n",
    "Distribution": "Nearctic (USA and Canada): golden eagle (also found in Palearctic), bald eagle\nNeotropical (Central and South America): Spizaetus (four species), solitary eagles (two spp.), harpy eagle, crested eagle, black-chested buzzard-eagle\nAustralasian\nAustralia: wedge-tailed eagle (range extends into southern New Guinea), white-bellied sea-eagle (range extends into Asia), little eagle\nNew Guinea: Papuan eagle, white-bellied sea-eagle, pygmy eagle\n",
    "Eagles in culture": "",
    "Etymology": "The modern English term for the bird is derived from Latin: aquila by way of French: aigle. The origin of aquila is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from either aquilus (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles or from aquilo (meaning north wind).\nOld English used the term earn, related to Scandinavia's ørn/örn. It is similar to other Indo-European terms for \"bird\" or \"eagle\", including Greek: ὄρνις (ornís), Russian: орёл (orël), and Welsh: eryr.\nIn Britain before 1678, eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being known as erne. The modern name \"golden eagle\" for aquila chrysaetos was introduced by the naturalist John Ray.\n",
    "Fish eagles": "Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion.\nProposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: Haliaeetus, Ichthyophaga.\nSome authors include Gypohierax angolensis, the \"vulturine fish eagle\" (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group. However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of Neophron–Gypaetus–Eutriorchis (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture (lammergeier), and Madagascan serpent eagle).\nThe fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with Haliastur and Milvus; the whole group is only distantly related to the Buteo group.\n",

    "Groups": "Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.\nThe snake eagles are placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner & Mindell proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae.\n",
    "Harpy eagles": "Harpy eagles or \"giant forest eagles\" are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches, and have traditionally been grouped together, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black-hawks, and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles.\nHarpy eagles (proposed subfamily Harpiinae)\nHarpia harpyja, harpy eagle ― Central and South America.\nMorphnus guianensis, crested eagle ― Central and South America.\nHarpyopsis novaeguineae, Papuan eagle ― New Guinea.\nPhilippine eagle\nPithecophaga jefferyi, Philippine eagle ― Philippines.\nSolitary eagles\nChaco eagle or crowned solitary eagle, Buteogallus (formerly Harpyhaliaetus) coronatus ― South America.\nSolitary eagle or montane solitary eagle, Buteogallus (formerly Harpyhaliaetus) solitarius ― South America.\n",
    "Heraldry": "Eagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the \"King of Birds\" in contrast to the lion, the \"King of Beasts\". They are particularly popular in Germanic countries such as Austria, due to their association with the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two divisions, East and West, of the old Roman Empire.\nHeraldic eagles are most often found displayed, i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur close, i.e. with their wings folded, or rising, i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles can also be found independently.\n",

    "Religion and folklore": "The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art.\nAncient writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.\nThe eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology) page.)\nPsalm 103 mentions renewing one's youth \"as the eagle\". Augustine of Hippo gives a curious explanation of this in his commentary on the Psalms.\nThe eagle is a common form in the Anglican tradition, often used to support the Bible because of the symbolism of spreading the gospel over the world. Additional symbolic meanings for \"eagle\" include the pronouncements to the Israelites in Exodus 19:4; Psalms 103:5 and Isaiah 40:31. The United States eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual reasons. In Canada, the poaching of eagle feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the crime.\n",
    "Snake eagles": "Snake or serpent eagles are, as the name suggests, adapted to hunting reptiles. [The bird does not look like a snake or serpent]\nSubfamily Circaetinae. Genera: Circaetus, Spilornis, Dryotriorchis, Terathopius.\nEutriorchis (subfamily Gypaetinae or Circaetinae).\nDespite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the Madagascan serpent eagle Eutriorchis is not related.\n",
    "Species": "Major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera Aquila and Hieraaetus are not composed of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some species being moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus.\nBonelli's eagle and the African hawk-eagle have been moved from Hieraaetus to Aquila.\nEither the greater spotted eagle and lesser spotted eagle should move from Aquila to join the long-crested eagle in Lophaetus, or, perhaps better, all three of these species should move to Ictinaetus with the black eagle.\nThe steppe eagle and tawny eagle, once thought to be conspecific, are not even each other's nearest relatives.\nFamily Accipitridae\nSubfamily Buteoninae – hawks (buzzards), true eagles and seaeagles\nGenus Geranoaetus\nBlack-chested buzzard-eagle, Geranoaetus melanoleucus\nGenus Harpyhaliaetus\nChaco eagle, Harpyhaliaetus coronatus\nSolitary eagle, H. solitarius\nGenus Morphnus\nCrested eagle, Morphnus guianensis\nGenus Harpia\nHarpy eagle, Harpia harpyja\nGenus Pithecophaga\nPhilippine eagle, Pithecophaga jefferyi\nGenus Harpyopsis\nPapuan eagle, Harpyopsis novaeguineae\nGenus Spizaetus\nBlack hawk-eagle, S. tyrannus\nOrnate hawk-eagle, S. ornatus\nBlack-and-white hawk-eagle, S. melanoleucus - formerly Spizastur\nBlack-and-chestnut eagle, S. isidori - formerly Oroaetus\nGenus Nisaetus - previously included in Spizaetus\nChangeable or crested hawk-eagle, N. cirrhatus\nFlores hawk-eagle N. floris - earlier a subspecies, S. c. floris\nSulawesi hawk-eagle, N. lanceolatus\nMountain hawk-eagle, N. nipalensis\nLegge's hawk-eagle, Nisaetus kelaarti - previously a race of S. nipalensis\nBlyth's hawk-eagle, N. alboniger\nJavan hawk-eagle, N. bartelsi\n(Northern) Philippine hawk-eagle, N. philippensis\nPinsker's hawk-eagle (Southern Philippine hawk-eagle), Nisaetus pinskeri - earlier S. philippensis pinskeri\nWallace's hawk-eagle, N. nanus\nGenus Lophaetus\nLong-crested eagle, Lophaetus occipitalis – possibly belongs in Ictinaetus\nGenus Stephanoaetus\nCrowned eagle, Stephanoaetus coronatus\nMalagasy crowned eagle, Stephanoaetus mahery (extinct)\nGenus Polemaetus\nMartial eagle, Polemaetus bellicosus\nGenus Hieraaetus\nAyres's hawk-eagle, H. ayresii\nLittle eagle, H. morphnoides\nPygmy eagle, H. weiskei - previously subspecies H. m. weiskei\nBooted eagle, H. pennatus\nGenus Harpagornis (extinct)\nHaast's eagle, †Harpagornis moorei – possibly belongs in either Hieraaetus or Aquila\nGenus Lophotriorchis\nRufous-bellied hawk-eagle, L. kienerii\nGenus Aquila\nBonelli's eagle, Aquila fasciata – formerly Hieraaetus fasciatus\nAfrican hawk-eagle, A. spilogaster – formerly in Hieraaetus\nCassin's hawk-eagle, A. africana – formerly in Hieraaetus or Spizaetus genera\nGolden eagle, A. chrysaetos\nEastern imperial eagle, A. heliaca\nSpanish imperial eagle A. adalberti\nSteppe eagle, A. nipalensis\nTawny eagle, A. rapax\nGreater spotted eagle, A. clanga – to be moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus\nLesser spotted eagle, A. pomarina – to be moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus\nIndian spotted eagle, A. hastata – to be moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus\nVerreaux's eagle, A. verreauxii\nGurney's eagle, A. gurneyi\nWahlberg's eagle, A. wahlbergi - to be moved to Hieraaetus\nWedge-tailed eagle, A. audax\nGenus Ictinaetus\nBlack eagle, Ictinaetus malayensis\nGenus Haliaeetus\nWhite-tailed eagle, Haliaeetus albicilla\nBald eagle, H. leucocephalus\nSteller's sea eagle, H. pelagicus\nAfrican fish eagle, H. vocifer\nWhite-bellied sea eagle, H. leucogaster\nSanford's sea eagle, H. sanfordi\nMadagascar fish eagle, H. vociferoides\nPallas' sea eagle, H. leucoryphus\nGenus Ichthyophaga\nLesser fish eagle, Ichthyophaga humilis\nGrey-headed fish eagle, I. ichthyaetus\nSubfamily Circaetinae: snake-eagles\nGenus Terathopius\nBateleur, Terathopius ecaudatus\nGenus Circaetus\nShort-toed snake eagle, Circaetus gallicus\nBlack-chested snake eagle, C. pectoralis\nBrown snake eagle, C. cinereus\nFasciated snake eagle, C. fasciolatus\nWestern banded snake eagle, C. cinerascens\nGenus Dryotriorchis\nCongo serpent eagle, D. spectabilis\nGenus Spilornis\nCrested serpent eagle, Spilornis cheela\nCentral Nicobar serpent eagle, S. minimus (subspecies or species)\nGreat Nicobar serpent eagle, S. klossi\nMountain serpent eagle, S. kinabaluensis\nSulawesi serpent eagle, S. rufipectus\nPhilippine serpent eagle, S. holospilus\nAndaman serpent eagle, S. elgini\nGenus Eutriorchis\nMadagascar serpent eagle, Eutriorchis astur\n"
