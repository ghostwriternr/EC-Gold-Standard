    "Behavior": "Martens are solitary animals, meeting only to breed in late spring or early summer. Litters of up to five blind and nearly hairless kits are born in early spring. They are weaned after around two months, and leave the mother to fend for themselves at about three to four months of age. Due to their habit of seeking warm and dry places and to gnaw on soft materials, martens cause damage to soft plastic and rubber parts in cars and other parked vehicles annually, costing millions of euros in Central Europe alone, thus leading to the offering of marten-damage insurance, \"marten-proofing\", and electronic repellent devices.\n",
    "Canada": "The marten is popular in the northern Ontario community of Big Trout Lake. During the fur trade, commissioned by the Hudson Bay Company in the 17th and 18th century, the marten pelt was typically fashioned into mittens. The marten is still traded locally. The locals place a high value on this pelt, typically trading it for chips, pop, and other consumable goods.\n",
    "Croatia": "In the Middle Ages, marten pelts were highly valued goods used as a form of payment in Slavonia, the Croatian Littoral, and Dalmatia. The banovac, a coin struck and used between 1235 and 1384, included the image of marten. This is one of the reasons why the Croatian word for marten, kuna, is the name of the modern Croatian currency. A marten is depicted on the obverse of the 1-, 2-, and 5-kuna coins, minted since 1993, and on the reverse of the 25-kuna commemorative coins.\nA running marten is shown on the coat of arms of Slavonia and subsequently on modern design of the coat of arms of Croatia. Official seal of the Croatian Sabor (parliament) from 1497 until the late 18th century had similar design.\n",

    "Diet": "Martens are omnivorous animals related to wolverines, minks, badgers, ferrets, and weasels. Their diet consists of squirrels, mice, rabbits, birds, fish, insects, and eggs, and they will also eat fruit and nuts when these are available.\n",
    "Etymology": "The Modern English marten comes from the Middle English martryn, in turn borrowed from the Anglo-French martrine and Old French martre (Latin martes), itself from a Germanic source; cf. Old English mearþ, Old Norse mörðr, Old High German and Yiddish מאַרדאַר mardar.\n",
    "Finland": "The Finnish communications company Nokia derives its name, via the river Nokianvirta, from a type of marten locally known as the nokia.\n",

    "Species": "Recent DNA research has shown that the genus Martes is in fact polyphyletic, placing Martes pennanti – and in some studies, Martes americana – outside the genus and allying it with Eira and Gulo, to form a new New World clade. The genus first evolved up to seven million years ago during the Miocene epoch.\nAmerican marten (Martes americana)\nNewfoundland pine marten (Martes americana atrata)\nYellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula)\nBeech marten (Martes foina)\nNilgiri marten (Martes gwatkinsii)\nPine marten (Martes martes)\nJapanese marten (Martes melampus)\nFisher (Martes pennanti)\nSable (Martes zibellina)\n"
