    "Etymology": "The English word \"jackal\" derives from Persian شغال shoghāl, cognate with Sanskrit सृगालः / sṛgālaḥ.\n",
    "Folklore, mythology and literature": "Like foxes and coyotes, jackals are often depicted as clever sorcerers in the myths and legends of their regions.\nAnubis (Ancient Greek: Ἄνουβις) is the Greek name for a jackal-headed god associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.\nThe jackal (likely the golden jackal, given its present range) is mentioned approximately 14 times in the Bible. It is frequently used as a literary device to illustrate desolation, loneliness and abandonment, with reference to its habit of living in the ruins of former cities and other areas abandoned by humans.\nSerer religion and creation myth posits the jackal was among the first animals created by Roog, the supreme deity of the Serer people.\nPablo Neruda's poem \"I Explain a Few Things\" describes Francisco Franco and his allies as \"...Jackals that the jackal would drive off...\".\nIn Rudyard Kipling's collection of stories The Jungle Book, the mad cowardly jackal Tabaqui feasts on the scraps of Shere Khan and the Seeonee wolf tribe.\nIn the King James translation of the Bible, Isaiah 13:21 refers to 'doleful creatures', which some commentators suggest are either jackals or hyenas.\nLiterature in India and Pakistan compares jackal with lion in terms of courage. A famous saying is \"One day life of a lion is better than a hundred years life of a jackal (Tipu Sultan)\".\nMultiple jackals are featured prominently throughout the Swiss Family Robinson.\n",

    "Interbreeding with dogs": "Experiments in Germany with breeding poodles and golden jackals have produced hybrids. The results showed that, unlike wolf–dog hybrids, jackal–dog hybrids show a decrease in fertility, significant communication problems, and an increase of genetic disorders after three generations of interbreeding, much like coydogs.\nIn Russia, golden jackals are one of the founder breeds of the Sulimov dog, a working dog owned exclusively by Aeroflot and used for bomb detection in airport security.\n",

    "Taxonomy and relationships": "The taxonomy of the jackals has evolved with scientific understanding about how they are related on the canid family tree.\nSimilarities between jackals and coyotes led Lorenz Oken, in the third volume of his Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte (1815), to place these species into a new separate genus, Thos, named after the classical Greek word θώς \"jackal\", but his theory had little immediate impact on taxonomy at the time. Angel Cabrera, in his 1932 monograph on the mammals of Morocco, questioned whether or not the presence of a cingulum on the upper molars of the jackals and its corresponding absence in the rest of Canis could justify a subdivision of the genus Canis. In practice, Cabrera chose the undivided-genus alternative and referred to the jackals as Canis instead of Thos.\nOken's Thos theory was revived in 1914 by Edmund Heller, who embraced the separate genus theory. Heller's names and the designations he gave to various jackal species and subspecies live on in current taxonomy, although the genus has been changed from Thos to Canis.\nModern research has clarified the relationships among the \"jackal\" species. Despite their similarities, jackals do not all stem from the same branch on the canid family tree. The side-striped jackal and black-backed jackal belong to a branch of canids that includes the dhole and African wild dog, while the golden jackal, on the other hand, belongs to a branch that includes the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), the coyote, and Canis lupus, the grey wolf/domestic dog. Because of this deep divergence between the black-backed/side-striped jackal and the golden jackal (as well as the rest of the \"wolf-like\" canids), it has been proposed to change the two species' generic name from Canis to Lupulella.\nThe intermediate size and shape of the Ethiopian wolf has at times led it to be regarded as a jackal, thus it has been called the \"red jackal\" or the \"Simien jackal\", but it has more often been considered and called a \"wolf\".\n"
