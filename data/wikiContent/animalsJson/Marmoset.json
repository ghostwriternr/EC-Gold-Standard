    "Behavior": "Marmosets are highly active, living in the upper canopy of forest trees, and feeding on insects, fruit and leaves. They have long lower incisors, which allow them to chew holes in tree trunks and branches to harvest the gum inside; some species are specialised feeders on gum.\nMarmosets live in family groups of three to 15, consisting of one to two breeding females, an unrelated male, their offspring and occasionally extended family members and unrelated individuals. Their mating systems are highly variable and can include monogamy, polygyny, and polyandry. In most species, fraternal twins are usually born, but triplets are not unknown. Like other callitrichines, marmosets are characterized by a high degree of cooperative care of the young and some food sharing and tolerated theft. Adult males, females other than the mother, and older offspring, participate in carrying infants. Most groups scent mark and defend the edges of their ranges, but it is unclear if they are truly territorial, as group home ranges greatly overlap.\nThe favorite food of marmosets is carbohydrate-rich tree sap, which they reach by gnawing holes in trunks. Their territories are centered on the trees that they regularly exploit in this way. The smaller marmosets venture into the very top of forest canopies to hunt insects that are abundant there.\n",
    "Human cultural references": "Callithrix comes from Ancient Greek and means \"beautiful fur\". Marmoset, from the French marmouset, is of uncertain etymology, although these monkeys are currently called ouistiti in French.\nThe monkey is mentioned in Shakespeare's Tempest, when Caliban says he will instruct his new master Stephano \"how to snare the nimble marmoset\" (for eating), on the no-man island where the play takes place (Act 2, Scene 2).\nThe notoriously mistranslated phrasebook English As She Is Spoke contains the nonsensical proverb \"to craunch the marmoset\".\nThe American leftist poet Genevieve Taggard compared a human's back and forth pacing to a marmoset in her poem \"Interior\".\nSax Rohmer's fictional Dr. Fu Manchu has a pet marmoset, often perched on his shoulder.\nOn November 2, 1979, Joan Embery from the San Diego Zoo brought a marmoset to The Tonight Show. In one of the most memorable moments in Tonight Show history, the marmoset climbed atop Johnny Carson's head, and urinated on it.\n",
