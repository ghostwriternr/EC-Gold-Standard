    "Mascot": "Conrad the Crawdad (established in 1993) is the official mascot of the Crawdads. Conrad, along with his partner Candy Crawdad entertain fans of the team.\nUpon purchasing a minor league baseball team from Gastonia, North Carolina, Don Beaver moved the team to his hometown of Hickory, North Carolina. Todd Teague named the team \"Hickory Crawdads.\" Shortly after, Beaver launched a contest requesting the community to assist him in naming the team's mascot. Ryan Windam, a native of Hickory, won the contest with the name \"Conrad.\" Thus, Conrad the Crawdad was born. Standing at approximately six feet tall, Conrad has not missed a single pitch since the team's inception in 1993.\n",
