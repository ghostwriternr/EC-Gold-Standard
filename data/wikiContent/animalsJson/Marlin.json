On the 85th day, Santiago, the old fisherman, hooks a resolute marlin; what follows is a great struggle between man, sea creature, and the elements.\nFrederick Forsyth's story The Emperor, in the collection No Comebacks, tells of a bank manager named Murgatroyd who catches a marlin and is acknowledged by the islanders of Mauritius as a master fisherman.\n",
