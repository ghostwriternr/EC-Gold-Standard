    "Etymology": "The term \"raven\" originally referred to the common raven, the type species of the genus Corvus, which has a larger distribution than any other species of Corvus, ranging over much of the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe modern English word raven has cognates in all other Germanic languages, including Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) hrafn and Old High German (h)raban, all of which descend from Proto-Germanic *hrabanaz.\nObsolete collective nouns for a group of ravens (or at least the common raven) include \"unkindness\" and \"conspiracy\". In practice, most people use the more generic \"flock\".\n",
    "Extinct species": "†Corvus moriorum – Chatham raven\n†Corvus antipodum – New Zealand raven\n†Corvus corax varius morpha leucophaeus – pied raven\n",
