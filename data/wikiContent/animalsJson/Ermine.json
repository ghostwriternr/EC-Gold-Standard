    "Ermine spots": "The ermine spot, the conventional heraldic representation of the tail, has had a wide variety of shapes over the centuries; its most usual representation has three tufts at the end (bottom), converges to a point at the root (top), and is attached by three studs. When \"ermine\" is specified as the tincture of the field (or occasionally of a charge), the spots are part of the tincture itself, rather than a semé or pattern of charges. The ermine spot (so specified), however, may also be used singly as a mobile charge, or as a mark of cadency signifying the absence of a blood relationship.\nOn a bend ermine, the tails follow the line of the bend. In the arms of William John Uncles, the field ermine is cut into bendlike strips by the three bendlets azure, so the ermine tails are (unusually) depicted bendwise.\n",
    "Later variations": "Though ermine and vair were the only two furs known to early armory, other variations of these developed later.\nErmines is the reverse of ermine – a field sable semé of ermine-spots argent. It is sometimes called counter-ermine (cf. French contre-hermine and German Gegenhermelin).\nErminois is ermine with a field Or instead of argent, and pean is the reverse of erminois (i.e. Or spots on a field sable).\nErminites is supposed to be the \"same as ermine, except that the two lateral hairs of each spot are red.\" James Parker mentions it, as does Pimbley, though by the former's admission this is of doubtful existence. Arthur Charles Fox-Davies describes it as a \"silly [invention] of former heraldic writers, not of former heralds.\"\nOther combinations of tinctures are explicitly stated, as in \"gules ermined argent\" (red with white ermine spots).\n",
