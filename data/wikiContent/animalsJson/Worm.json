    "Imagery in the arts": "Worms are sometimes used as a metaphor of putrefaction or corruption; a corpse may be said to be \"fed to the worms\".\n",
    "Informal grouping": "In everyday language, the term worm is also applied to various other living forms such as larvae, insects, millipedes, centipedes, shipworms (teredo worms), or even some vertebrates (creatures with a backbone) such as blindworms and caecilians. Worms can be divided into several groups, but are still technically decomposers.\nThe first of these, Platyhelminthes, includes the flatworms, tapeworms, and flukes. They have a flat, ribbon- or leaf-shaped body with a pair of eyes at the front. Some are parasites.\nThe second group contains the threadworms, roundworms, and hookworms. This phylum is called Nematoda. Threadworms may be microscopic, such as the vinegar eelworm, or more than 1 metre (3 feet) long. They are found in damp earth, moss, decaying substances, fresh water, or salt water. Some roundworms are also parasites. The Guinea worm, for example, gets under the skin of the feet and legs of people living in tropical countries.\nThe third group consists of the segmented worms, with bodies divided into segments, or rings. This phylum is called Annelida. Among these are the earthworms and the bristle worms of the sea.\nIn earlier taxonomic classification, all the above were included in the now obsolete group Vermes, a paraphyletic assemblage of unrelated phyla.\nFamiliar worms include the earthworms, members of phylum Annelida. Other invertebrate groups may be called worms, especially colloquially. In particular, many unrelated insect larvae are called \"worms\", such as the railroad worm, woodworm, glowworm, bloodworm, inchworm, mealworm, silkworm, and wooly bear worm.\nWorms may also be called helminths, particularly in medical terminology when referring to parasitic worms, especially the Nematoda (roundworms) and Cestoda (tapeworms). Hence \"helminthology\" is the study of parasitic worms. When a human or an animal, such as a dog or horse, is said to \"have worms\", it means that it is infested with parasitic worms, typically roundworms or tapeworms. Deworming is a method to kill off the worms that have infected a human or animal by giving anthelmintic drugs.\n\"Ringworm\" is not a worm at all, but a skin fungus.\n",

    "Society and culture": "Wurm, or wyrm was the Old English term for carnivorous reptiles (\"serpents\"), and mythical dragons. Worm has been used as a pejorative epithet to describe a cowardly, weak or pitiable person.\n"
