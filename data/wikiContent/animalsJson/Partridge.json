    "Cultural references": "According to Greek legend, the first partridge appeared when Daedalus threw his nephew, Perdix, off the sacred hill of Athena in a fit of jealous rage. Supposedly mindful of his fall, the bird does not build its nest in the trees, nor take lofty flights and avoids high places.\nThe most famous reference to the partridge is the first gift listed in the Christmas carol, \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". As such, \"A partridge in a pear tree\" is sung as the last line of each verse. Since partridges are unlikely to be seen in pear-trees (they are ground-nesting birds) the text \"in a pear tree\" may be a corruption of the French \"une perdrix\".\nThe partridge has also been used as a symbol that represents Kurdish nationalism. It is called Kew. Sherko Kurmanj discusses the paradox of symbols in Iraq as an attempt to make a distinction between the Kurds and the Arabs. He says that while Iraqis generally regards the palm tree, falcon, and sword as their national symbols, the Kurds consider the Oak, Partridge, and dagger as theirs.\n",
    "Description": "These are medium-sized birds, intermediate between the larger pheasants and the smaller quails. Partridges are native to the grassy steppes of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Nowadays they are often found nesting on agricultural land. They nest on the ground and have a diet consisting of seeds and insects. Species such as the grey partridge and the red-legged partridge are popular as game birds, and are often reared in captivity and released for the purpose of hunting. For the same reason, they have been introduced into large areas of North America.\n",
