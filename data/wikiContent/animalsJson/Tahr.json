    "Behavior": "A routine of feeding during the morning followed by a long rest period, then feeding in the evening, constitutes the tahrs daily routine. Tahrs are not generally active or feed at night and can be found at the same location morning and evening.\n",
    "Ranges": "While the Arabian Tahr of Oman and the Nilgiri Tahr of South India both have small ranges and are considered endangered, the Himalayan Tahr remains relatively widespread in the Himalayas, and has been introduced to the Southern Alps of New Zealand where it is hunted recreationally. There is also a population on Table Mountain in South Africa, descended from a pair of tahrs which escaped from a zoo in 1936, but most of these have been culled.\n",
