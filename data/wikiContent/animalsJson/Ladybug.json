    "Animation": "When Toei Animation joined as a co-producer in June 2012, it was also announced that the show would be drawn in a colourful manga-like style. Later in September, Toei released a traditionally-animated promotional video for Ladybug. The video featured Marinette as Ladybug and a (now-scrapped) different character named Félix as Cat Noir.\nThe anime concept was successful; however, there were concerns about the marketability of traditional 2D, and the difficulty in animating Ladybug's costume of red with black spots, as it caused some strobing effects. Executive producer Jared Wolfson said that Zag wanted the animation to be cinematic and epic, unique and different, and said that they are continuing to partner with Toei as it brings in the Asian inspiration and that a 2D version might be a potential product.\nThe aforementioned problem with 2D animation was resolved by moving to CGI animation; the switch also allowed for easier implementation of mobile camera angles.. SAMG Animation, a CGI animation studio located in South Korea which officially joined in the production in November 2012, produced modeling and animation. Astruc and assistant director Wilfried Pain instructed the animators not to improvise scenes so that they could keep things consistent and understandable. Pain estimated about 350-400 shots are used in a typical 20-minute episode; with 10 panels per shot, that makes up to 4000 panels an episode. Wolfson said that the show's animation brings dynamic camera angles and texturing. A trailer with the new CGI-animated style was released in October 2013.\n",
    "Characters": "Marinette Dupain-Cheng a.k.a. Ladybug (voiced by Cristina Vee in English version, Anouck Hautbois in French version) is an aspiring fashion designer at Collège Françoise-Dupont. Marinette is sweet, joyful, and a bit awkward, but respected by her peers. She has a big crush on Adrien, whom she can barely speak to out of nervousness and embarrassment; her best friend Alya is often seen trying to help Marinette declare her love to him, although it ends in disaster. She can transform into the superheroine \"Ladybug\" with the help of her Kwami, Tikki, to defend Paris with her crime-fighting partner Cat Noir. Her special superpower, Lucky Charm, creates an object and allows her to identify other key objects that she can use with the created object to defeat the villains. Among the superheroes that use Miraculous, she is responsible for capturing and purifying the akuma butterflies. As Ladybug, she brushes off Cat Noir's advances, unaware that Cat Noir's alter-ego is the source of her own affections. Astruc describes Ladybug as a positive character who brings happiness, like a candy, and like Amélie Poulain crossed with Spider-Man.\nAdrien Agreste a.k.a. Cat Noir (voiced by Bryce Papenbrook in English version, Benjamin Bollen in French version) is Marinette's classmate and a popular fashion model for his father's clothing company. He transforms into the superhero \"Cat Noir\" (French: Chat Noir, lit. \"black cat\") with the help of his Kwami, Plagg, to assist Ladybug in saving Paris. Adrien is kind and well-liked, and hangs out often with his best friend Nino. Though his family is wealthy, he laments his poor relationship with his stern father, Gabriel; his mother, meanwhile, has disappeared. He is in love with Ladybug, despite not knowing her true identity, and tries to impress her, although he makes bad jokes and cat-themed puns as Cat Noir, which frequently annoy her. His special ability, Cataclysm, allows him to destroy an object that he touches with a swipe of his paw.\nTikki (voiced by Mela Lee in English version, Marie Nonenmacher in French version) is Marinette's Kwami who allows her to transform into Ladybug. Tikki is a small floating magical humanoid with a large head, big eyes, and a red body with large black spots on her head, resembling a ladybug. She believes strongly in Marinette and gives her advice to be the best she can be, regardless of transformation. When asked by Marinette whether she is over 5000 years old, Tikki replies that she is older than that, and had watched over every Ladybug since the beginning. During her charge's transformation as Ladybug, she inhabits the Ladybug Miraculous, a pair of shiny black earrings that Marinette wears. One of the two strongest of the Miraculouses, it has the power of creation. Astruc has written on Twitter that Tikki means \"happiness\".\nPlagg (voiced by Max Mittelman in English version, Thierry Kazazian in French version) is Adrien's Kwami who enables him to transform into Cat Noir. Plagg looks much like Tikki, but with a black body, green eyes and pointed ears, resembling a black cat. Unlike Tikki, however, Plagg is sarcastic and lazy. His favorite food is camembert, a stinky cheese. During his charge's transformation as Cat Noir, he inhabits the Black Cat Miraculous, a large silver ring that Adrien wears on his right hand. One of the two strongest of the Miraculouses, it has the power of destruction. Astruc has written on Twitter that Plagg means \"plague\".\nHawk Moth (French: le Papillon, lit. \"the butterfly\"; voiced by Keith Silverstein in English version, Antoine Tomé in French version) is a mysterious villain who has the power to create new super-villains with his akuma, which are butterflies that he corrupts with his dark power. He preys on people who are at a point of weakness and appeals to their negative emotions, such as fear, sadness, anger or jealousy. In exchange for granting them powers to exact revenge on those who have wronged them, he asks his villains to steal Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses for him, so that he may use both to gain immense power. He possesses the Moth Miraculous. Long believed to be lost, its original purpose is to create superheroes, but because Hawk Moth has it, he is able to use the power of both Miraculous and its Kwami for his plans.\nChloé Bourgeois (voiced by Selah Victor in English version, Marie Chevalot in French version) is the mayor's daughter and a classmate of Marinette and Adrien. Chloé is extremely mean, snobby, spoiled and thinks the world revolves around her. She often bullies and ridicules her classmates, resulting in the latter's sadness and despair and becoming a target for Hawk Moth's transforming them into villains. She has an unrequited crush on Adrien, and often tries to charm and kiss him, much to his discomfort, and resulting in a constant rivalry with Marinette for his affections. Like the other students, she has no knowledge of Ladybug's identity, and is a big fan of Ladybug, often trying to take pictures with her; she even has a Ladybug costume. In the episode \"Antibug\", she herself is influenced by Hawk Moth and becomes the supervillain Antibug, who wants revenge on Ladybug for pushing her aside. In the episode \"Ladybug & Cat Noir - Origins, Part 1\", it is revealed that she has been classmates with Marinette for four consecutive years.\nAlya Césaire (voiced by Carrie Keranen in English version, Fanny Bloc in French version) is Marinette's best friend who typically wears a plaid shirt and black glasses. She constantly helps Marinette with her problems, most of which pertain to Marinette attempting, and failing, to speak to Adrien; she is often seen encouraging and helping her to talk to him. She aspires to be a journalist and is in charge of the school blog. She is a big fan of superheroes and like her peers, is a massive fan of Ladybug; she even operates a fansite known as the Ladyblog, but like everyone else, is unaware of Marinette's superhero identity. In the episode \"Lady Wifi\", she is influenced by Hawk Moth and becomes the supervillain Lady Wifi. Alya's family name is Césaire, her family originally from Martinique, a French overseas territory in the Caribbean. Her mother works as a chef at the Grand Paris hotel.\nNino Lahiffe (voiced by Benjamin Diskin in English version, Alexandre Nguyen in French version) is Adrien's best friend who dresses in skate punk fashion, typically seen with headphones around his neck and a cap on his head. He DJs at the school's radio station. Nino is fond of Marinette, but ultimately discovers that he has more in common with Alya. In the episode \"The Bubbler\", he is influenced by Hawk Moth and becomes the supervillain the Bubbler. When asked about Alya and Nino's ethnicity, Astruc wrote on Twitter that one of them was from Réunion, and later wrote that Alya was from Martinique.\nTom Dupain and Sabine Cheng are Marinette's parents who operate the renowned bakery that the family lives above. Tom is a burly French man who is very passionate about his baking and loves to play video games with his daughter. Sabine is a petite Chinese woman who runs the storefront, and is known for her love and warmth towards her family and her city.\nSabrina is Chloé's only friend and her assistant. Chloé often treats Sabrina as her lackey: Sabrina does Chloé's homework for her and runs her errands, and in return, Chloé charms her with expensive, fashionable clothing. She has orange hair and wears glasses. In the episode \"Antibug\", Sabrina is angry at Chloé for ignoring her, and becomes influenced by Hawk Moth, turning into the supervillain the Vanisher, who is invisible to the human eye. Astruc wrote on Twitter that Chloé, Sabrina and another classmate named Alix were originally intended to become a trio as a reference to the title characters in another French animated series, Totally Spies!.\n",
    "Conception and creation": "The series is based on an original concept created by French animator Thomas Astruc, who was inspired by a meeting with a certain lady, Japanese anime, and \"decades of comics binge reading\". In an interview with Nolife, Astruc said he was working as an animator on the show W.I.T.C.H. when he met a woman who had a T-shirt with a ladybug on it. They began to share drawings, some of which were ladybug-themed. Astruc also noted that Marinette's hair was styled after the woman. They also worked on the cartoon A.T.O.M. around 2004–05. Astruc first drew Ladybug on sticky notes and remarked how strong the Ladybug character was, but despite this, he had no memory of seeing any ladybug-themed superheroes in comics.\nAstruc had intended to make Ladybug a comic book series until he met Jeremy Zag, who loved the project and wanted to produce it as a cartoon; Zag was 25 at the time and not originally from the cartoon industry. In developing Cat Noir, Astruc said that ladybugs represented good luck, so it was natural to partner her with a black cat character with bad luck powers. Cat Noir was a tribute to comics characters like Catwoman, so it was like having Catwoman and Spider-Man in the same show but reversed. In 2010, the show was announced at Cannes' MIPCOM with French production groups Univergroup Pictures and Onyx Films heading the project and working with Method Animation and Zagtoon. Aton Soumache of Onyx and Method said that they want \"to create a glamourous superhero character with a real European flair with Paris as [the] backdrop.\" The producers had also planned to animate it in stereoscopic 3D.\nA character named Félix was originally going to have the role of Cat Noir, but he was later scrapped in favor of Adrien because the creative team felt that Félix was a cliché of a male anime protagonist, and that Adrien would allow them to tell more interesting stories. In September 2015, Astruc indicated that he was open to revisiting the character of Félix, but abandoned it by February 2016, writing that the character was a poor idea.\nIn June 2012, Toei Animation in Japan was announced as a co-producer. Toei Animation had released a Pretty Cure film that was set in Paris, and was interested in expanding their international audience. Even after the production was moved to CGI animation, Toei remained as co-producer, with executive producers from the company being credited.\nOn 21 November 2012, a memorandum of understanding between Zagtoon, Method Animation, SAMG Animation and SK Broadband was announced: together, the companies would invest $50 million USD through 2017 into five projects. The first of these projects developed into Miraculous, which received an investment of $10 million. As a part of the deal, SK Broadband would have exclusive rights in South Korea for video on demand release, available to the subscribers of the company's IPTV platform B TV.\n",

She \"quickly realized there was a far cooler and broader Miraculous movement underway\". Caitlin Donovan of entertainment website Epicstream listed it as one of her top 10 animated series of 2015. She wrote that \"The characters are so charming that the tropey aspects of the show are merely a lot of fun, rather than irritating.\" with creative fights and good CGI animation. She wrote that \"Marinette is an adorable lead who is genuinely awkward as a civilian, but confident as a superhero, which makes for an interesting contrast.\" Ella Anders of BSCKids wrote that the show stands out because of \"how it meshes both the magical girl and superhero genera together\".\nThe North American Precis Syndicate called the show \"authentic and aspirational – a story of today's modern everygirl superhero who comes to life. The series, about a young girl who taps into her superhero powers and innocent optimism to save Paris from the evil Hawk Moth, will no doubt inspire today's youth to try to save the day, each and every day in their own way\". Andrea Reiher of Zap2It wrote that the \"storylines are rich with family, friends, adventure, intrigue, villains, creativity and more, delivering themes that are relatable and relevant to kids and preteens\" and anticipated it would be a huge hit on Nickelodeon.\nSeveral media reviewers have anticipated Miraculous-brand toys to be among the hot superheroine properties for 2016.
