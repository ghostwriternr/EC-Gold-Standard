    "Competitions": "Canaries are judged in competitions following the annual molt in the summer. This means that in the Northern Hemisphere the show season generally begins in October or November and runs through December or January. Birds can only be shown by the person who raised them. A show bird must have a unique band on its leg indicating the year of birth, the band number, and the club to which the breeder belongs.\nThere are many canary shows all over the world. The world show (C.O.M.) is held in Europe each year and attracts thousands of breeders. As many as 20,000 birds are brought together for this competition.\n",
    "Etymology": "The birds are named after Spain's Canary Islands, which derive their name from the Latin Insula Canaria (after one of the larger islands, Gran Canaria), meaning \"island of dogs\", due to its \"vast multitudes of dogs of very large size\".\n",

    "Miner's canary": "Canaries were once regularly used in coal mining as an early warning system. Toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, methane  or carbon dioxide in the mine would kill the bird before affecting the miners. Signs of distress from the bird indicated to the miners that conditions were unsafe. The use of miners' canaries in British mines was phased out in 1987.\nThe phrase \"canary in a coal mine\" is frequently used to refer to a person or thing which serves as an early warning of a coming crisis. By analogy, the term climate canary is used to refer to a species that is affected by an environmental danger prior to other species, thus serving as an early warning system for the other species with regard to the danger. (See indicator species.)\n",

    "Trivia": "Canaries have been depicted in cartoons from the mid-20th century as being harassed by domestic cats; the most famous cartoon canary is Warner Brothers' \"Tweety Bird\".\nNorwich City, an English football team, is nicknamed \"The Canaries\" due to the city once being a famous centre for breeding and export of the birds. The club adopted the colours of yellow and green in homage. Jacob Mackley, of Norwich, won many prizes with birds of the local variety and shipped about 10,000 Norwich to New York every year. In the early 1900s, he opened his aviaries to the public for three days and 10,000 people turned up.\nKoper, a Slovenian football team are nicknamed \"The Canaries\" (Kanarčki).\nFC Novi Sad, a Serbian football team from Novi Sad are also nicknamed after the birds, due to their home kits being completely yellow.\nFenerbahçe, a Turkish football team, is nicknamed Sarı Kanaryalar (Turkish for \"Yellow Canaries\").\n",
    "Use in research": "Canaries have been extensively used in research to study neurogenesis, or the birth of new neurons in the adult brain, and also for basic research in order to understand how songbirds encode and produce song. Thus, canaries have served as model species for discovering how the vertebrate brain learns, consolidates memories, and recalls coordinated motor movements.\nFernando Nottebohm, a professor at the Rockefeller University in New York City, detailed the brain structures and pathways that are involved in the production of bird song. Canaries were used by SINGARENI coal company of Telangana STATE of India for detection of carbon monoxide under coal mines.\n",
    "Varieties": "Canaries are generally divided into three main groups:\nColour bred canaries (bred for their many colour mutations - ino, eumo, satinette, bronze, ivory, onyx, mosaic, brown and red factor etc.)\nType canaries (bred for their shape and conformation - Australian Plainhead, Berner, Border, Fife, Gibber Italicus, Gloster, Lancashire, Raza Española, Yorkshire, etc.)\nSong canaries (bred for their unique and specific song patterns - Spanish Timbrado, German Roller (also known as Harz Roller), Waterslager (also known as \"Malinois\"), American Singer, Russian Singer, Persian Singer).\nWhile wild canaries are a yellowish-green colour, domestic canaries have been selectively bred for a wide variety of colours, such as yellow, orange, brown, black, white, and red. (The colour red was introduced to the domesticated canary through hybridisation with the red siskin, a type of South American finch.)\n"
