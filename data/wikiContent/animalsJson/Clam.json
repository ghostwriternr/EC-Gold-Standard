    "Anatomy": "A clam's shell consists of two (usually equal) valves, which are connected by a hinge joint and a ligament that can be external or internal. The ligament provides tension to bring the valves apart, while one or two adductor muscles can contract to close the valves. Clams also have kidneys, a heart, a mouth, a stomach, a nervous system and an anus. Many have a siphon.\n",
    "As currency": "Some species of clams, particularly Mercenaria mercenaria, were in the past used by the Algonquians of Eastern North America to manufacture wampum, a type of shell money.\n",

In Malabar region it is known as \"elambakka\" and in middle kerala it is known as \"kakka\". clams curry made with coconut is so delicious dish from malabar especially in Telicherry region. In the south western coast of India, also known as the Konkan region in the state of Maharashtra, clams are used to cook curries and side dishes, like Tisaryachi Ekshipi, which is clams with one shell on.

    "Italy": "In Italy, clams are often an ingredient of mixed seafood dishes or are eaten together with pasta. The more commonly used varieties of clams in Italian cooking are the Vongola (Venerupis decussata), the Cozza (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and the Tellina (Donax trunculus). Though Dattero di mare (Lithophaga lithophaga) was once eaten, overfishing drove it to the verge of extinction (it takes 15 to 35 years to reach adult size and could only be harvested by smashing the calcarean rocks that form its habitat) and the Italian government has declared it an endangered species since 1998 and its harvest and sale are forbidden.\n",
    "Japan": "In Japan, clams are often an ingredient of mixed seafood dishes. They can also be made into hot pot, miso soup or Tsukudani. The more commonly used varieties of clams in Japanese cooking are the Asari (Venerupis philippinarum) and the Hamaguri (Meretrix lusoria).\n",
    "North America": "In culinary use, within the eastern coast of the United States, the term \"clam\" most often refers to the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria. It may also refer to a few other common edible species, such as the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria and the ocean quahog, Arctica islandica. Another species commercially exploited on the Atlantic Coast of the United States is the surf clam Spisula solidissima. Scallops are also used for food.\nClams can be eaten raw, steamed, boiled, baked or fried. They can also be made into clam chowder or they can be cooked using hot rocks and seaweed in a New England clam bake.\n",

    "Terminology": "In the United States, the word \"clam\" has several different meanings. First, it can generally refer to all bivalve molluscs. In the more limited sense, the term refers to the large subset of bivalves living as infauna, rather than those attached to a substrate (like oysters and mussels) or those that lie and move near the bottom or swim (like scallops). It can also refer to one or more kinds of commonly consumed marine bivalves, such as in the phrase clam chowder, which refers to shellfish soup. Many edible clams are roughly oval-shaped or triangular; however, razor clams have an elongated parallel-sided shell, suggesting an old-fashioned straight razor.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"clam\" is one of the common names of various species of marine bivalve mollusc, but it is not used as a term covering either edible clams that burrow or bivalves in general.\nNumerous edible marine bivalve species live buried in sand or mud and respire by means of siphons, which reach to the surface. In the United States, these clams are collected by \"digging for clams\" or clam digging.\nThe word \"clam\" is used in the idiom \"to clam up\", meaning to refuse to talk or answer, based on the clam behaviour of quickly closing the shell when threatened. A \"clamshell\" is the name given to a container or mobile phone consisting of two hinged halves that lock together. Clams have also inspired the phrase \"happy as a clam\", short for \"happy as a clam at high tide\" (when it can't easily be dug up and eaten).\n",
    "Trinidad and Tobago": "Clams and shellfish are locally called \"chipchip\", and local fishermen sell them in rural markets.\n"
