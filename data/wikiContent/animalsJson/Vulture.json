    "Feeding": "Vultures rarely attack healthy animals, but may kill the wounded or sick. When a carcass has too thick of a hide for its beak to open, it waits for a larger scavenger to eat first. Vast numbers have been seen upon battlefields. They gorge themselves when prey is abundant, until their crops bulge, and sit, sleepy or half torpid, to digest their food. These birds do not carry food to their young in their claws, but disgorge it from their crops.\nVultures are of great value as scavengers, especially in hot regions. Vulture stomach acid is exceptionally corrosive, allowing them to safely digest putrid carcasses infected with botulinum toxin, hog cholera bacteria, and anthrax bacteria that would be lethal to other scavengers. New World vultures often vomit when threatened or approached. Contrary to some accounts, they do not \"projectile vomit\" on their attacker as a deliberate defense, but it does lighten their stomach load to make take-off easier, and the vomited meal residue may distract a predator, allowing the bird to escape.\nNew World vultures also urinate straight down their legs; the uric acid kills bacteria accumulated from walking through carcasses, and also acts as evaporative cooling.\n",
    "New World vultures": "The New World vultures and condors found in warm and temperate areas of the Americas are not closely related to the similar Accipitridae, but belong in the family Cathartidae, which was once considered to be related to the storks. However, recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be included among the Accipitriformes, along with other birds of prey. However, they are still not closely related to the other vultures. Several species have a good sense of smell, unusual for raptors, and are able to smell dead animals from great heights, up to a mile away.\nThe seven species are:\nBlack vulture Coragyps atratus in South America and north to the US\nTurkey vulture Cathartes aura throughout the Americas to southern Canada\nLesser yellow-headed vulture Cathartes burrovianus in South America and north to Mexico\nGreater yellow-headed vulture Cathartes melambrotus in the Amazon Basin of tropical South America\nCalifornia condor Gymnogyps californianus in California, formerly widespread in the mountains of western North America\nAndean condor Vultur gryphus in the Andes\nKing vulture Sarcoramphus papa from southern Mexico to northern Argentina\n",
    "Old World vultures": "The Old World vultures found in Africa, Asia, and Europe belong to the family Accipitridae, which also includes eagles, kites, buzzards, and hawks. Old World vultures find carcasses exclusively by sight.\nThe 16 species in 9 genera are:\nCinereous vulture, Aegypius monachus\nGriffon vulture, Gyps fulvus\nWhite-rumped vulture, Gyps bengalensis\nRÃ¼ppell's vulture, Gyps rueppelli\nIndian vulture, Gyps indicus\nSlender-billed vulture, Gyps tenuirostris\nHimalayan vulture, Gyps himalayensis\nWhite-backed vulture, Gyps africanus\nCape vulture, Gyps coprotheres\nHooded vulture, Necrosyrtes monachus\nRed-headed vulture, Sarcogyps calvus\nLappet-faced vulture, Torgos tracheliotos\nWhite-headed vulture, Trigonoceps occipitalis\nBearded vulture (Lammergeier), Gypaetus barbatus\nEgyptian vulture, Neophron percnopterus\nPalm-nut vulture, Gypohierax angolensis\n",

    "Status": "Vultures in south Asia, mainly in India and Nepal, have declined dramatically since the early 1990s. It has been found that this decline was caused by residues of the veterinary drug Diclofenac in animal carcasses. The government of India has taken very late cognizance of this fact and has banned the drug for animals. However, it may take decades for vultures to come back to their earlier population level, if they ever do: without vultures to pick corpses clean, rabies-carrying dogs have multiplied, feeding on the carrion, and age-old practices like the sky burials of the Parsees are coming to an end, permanently reducing the supply of corpses. The same problem is also seen in Nepal where government has taken some late steps to conserve remaining vultures.\nA recent study in 2016, reported that \"of the 22 vulture species, nine are critically endangered, three are endangered, four are near threatened, and six are least concern\".\n"
