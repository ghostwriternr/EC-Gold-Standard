    "Biogeography": "The centres of stork diversity are in tropical Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with eight and six breeding species respectively. Just three species are present in the New World: wood stork, maguari stork and jabiru, which is the largest flying bird of the Americas. Two species, white and black stork, reach Europe and western temperate Asia, while one species, Oriental stork, reaches temperate areas of eastern Asia, and one species, black-necked stork, is found in Australasia.\n",
    "Etymology": "The Modern English word can be traced back to Proto-Germanic *sturkaz. Nearly every Germanic language has a descendant of this proto-language word to indicate the (white) stork. Related names also occur in Latvian, \"stārks\", and some Slavic languages, e.g. \"štorklja\" in Slovenian and \"щъркел\" [shtŭrkel] in Bulgarian, originating as Germanic loanwords.\nAccording to the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the Germanic root is probably related to the modern English \"stark\", in reference to the stiff or rigid posture of a European species, the white stork. A non-Germanic word linked to it may be Greek torgos (\"vulture\").\nIn some West Germanic languages cognate words of a different etymology exist, e.g. 'ooievaar' in Dutch. They originate from *uda-faro, uda being related to water meaning something like swamp or moist area and faro being related to fare; so *uda-faro is something like he who walks in the swamp. In later times this name got reanalysed as *ōdaboro, ōda \"fortune, wealth\" + boro \"bearer\" meaning he who brings wealth adding to the myth of storks as maintainers of welfare and bringers of children.\nIn Estonian, \"stork\" is toonekurg, which is derived from toonela (underworld in Estonian folklore) + kurg (crane). At the times storks were named, the now-rare black stork was probably the more common species.\n",

    "Fossil storks": "Genus Palaeoephippiorhynchus (fossil: Early Oligocene of Fayyum, Egypt)\nGenus Grallavis (fossil: Early Miocene of Saint-Gérand-le-Puy, France, and Djebel Zelten, Libya) – may be same as Prociconia\nCiconiidae gen. et sp. indet. (Ituzaingó Late Miocene of Paraná, Argentina)\nCiconiidae gen. et sp. indet. (Puerto Madryn Late Miocene of Punta Buenos Aires, Argentina)\nGenus Prociconia (fossil: Late Pleistocene of Brazil) – may belong to modern genus Jabiru or Ciconia\nGenus Pelargosteon (fossil: Early Pleistocene of Romania)\nCiconiidae gen. et sp. indet. – formerly Aquilavus/Cygnus bilinicus (fossil: Early Miocene of Břešťany, Czech Republic)\ncf.

(fossil: Late Pleistocene of San Josecito Cavern, Mexico)\nThe fossil genera Eociconia (Middle Eocene of China) and Ciconiopsis (Deseado Early Oligocene of Patagonia, Argentina) are often tentatively placed with this family. A \"ciconiiform\" fossil fragment from the Touro Passo Formation found at Arroio Touro Passo (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) might be of the living wood stork M. americana; it is at most of Late Pleistocene age, a few 10,000s of years.\n",

    "Systematics": "A DNA study found that the families Ardeidae, Balaenicipitidae, Scopidae and the Threskiornithidae belong to the Pelecaniformes. This would make Ciconiidae the only group.\nStorks were distinct and possibly widespread by the Oligocene. Like most families of aquatic birds, storks seem to have arisen in the Palaeogene, maybe 40–50 million years ago (mya). For the fossil record of living genera, documented since the Middle Miocene (about 15 mya) at least in some cases, see the genus articles.\nThough some storks are highly threatened, no species or subspecies are known to have gone extinct in historic times. A Ciconia bone found in a rock shelter on the island of Réunion was probably of a bird taken there as food by early settlers; no known account mentions the presence of storks on the Mascarene Islands.\n"
