    "Adult": "Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, allowing for phenomenal growth rates. Average 30–90 days.\nA flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days.\nNewly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained. However, completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21 °C to 30 °C (70 °F to 85 °F) and optimum humidity is 70%.\nAdult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, can detect the changing levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate it is getting close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make their way back to the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.\n",
    "As a vector": "Fleas are vectors for viral, bacterial and rickettsial diseases of humans and other animals, as well as of protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.\n",
    "Direct effects of bites": "Fleas are a nuisance to their hosts, causing an itching sensation which in turn may result in the host attempting to remove the pest by biting, pecking, scratching, etc. in the vicinity of the parasite. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites generally cause the formation of a slightly raised, swollen itching spot with a single puncture point at the center (similar to a mosquito bite). Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is a common condition in dogs and cats.\nThe bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can also lead to hair loss as a result of frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.\n",
    "Diversity": "Siphonaptera is a relatively small order of insects: members of the order undergo complete metamorphosis and are secondarily wingless (their ancestors had wings which modern forms have lost). In 2005, Medvedev listed 2005 species in 242 genera, and despite subsequent descriptions of new species, this is the most complete database available. The order is divided into four infraorders and eighteen families. Some families are exclusive to a single host group; these include the Malacopsyllidae (armadillos), Ischnopsyllidae (bats) and Chimaeropsyllidae (elephant shrews).\n",
    "Eggs": "The flea life cycle begins when the female lays after feeding. Eggs are laid in batches of up to 20 or so, usually on the host itself, which means that the eggs can easily roll onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps become one of the primary habitats of eggs and developing fleas. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch.\n",
    "Flea treatments": "See Flea treatments\n",
    "Larvae": "Flea larvae emerge from the eggs to feed on any available organic material such as dead insects, feces, conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark places such as sand, cracks and crevices, and bedding.\n",
    "Life cycle and habitat": "Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.\n",
    "Morphology and behavior": "Fleas are wingless insects, 1/16 to 1/8-inch (1.5 to 3.3 mm) long, that are agile, usually dark colored (for example, the reddish-brown of the cat flea), with a proboscis, or stylet, adapted to feeding by piercing the skin and sucking their host's blood through their epipharynx. They interestingly do not possess a mandible. Their legs are long, the hind pair well adapted for jumping; a flea can jump vertically up to 7 in (18 cm) and horizontally up to 13 in (33 cm), making the flea one of the best jumpers of all known animals (relative to body size), second only to the froghopper. If humans had the jumping power of a flea, a 1.8-m (6-ft) person could make a jump 90 m (295 ft) long and 49 m (160 ft) high. Their legs end in strong claws that are designed to grasp a host.\nResearchers with the University of Cambridge in England found that fleas take off from their tibiae and tarsi (the insect equivalent of feet) and not their trochantera, or knees. It has been known that fleas do not use direct muscle power, but instead use the muscle to store energy in a protein named resilin before releasing it rapidly (like a human using a bow and arrow), with researchers using high-speed video technology and mathematical models to discover where the spring action actually happens.\nUnlike other insects, fleas do not possess compound eyes but instead only have simple eyespots with a single biconvex lens; some species lack eyes altogether. Their bodies are laterally compressed, permitting easy movement through the hairs or feathers on the host's body (or in the case of humans, under clothing). The flea body is covered with hard plates called sclerites. These sclerites are covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward, which also assist its movements on the host. The tough body is able to withstand great pressure, likely an adaptation to survive attempts to eliminate them by mashing or scratching. Even hard squeezing between the fingers is normally insufficient to kill a flea.\nFleas lay tiny, white, oval-shaped eggs better viewed through a loupe or magnifying glass. The larva is small and pale, has bristles covering its worm-like body, lacks eyes, and has mouth parts adapted to chewing. The larvae feed on various organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas. The adult flea's diet consists solely of fresh blood. In the pupal phase, the insect is enclosed in a silken, debris-covered cocoon.\n",
    "Pupae": "Given an adequate supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons within 1–2 weeks after three larval stages. After another week or two, the adult fleas are fully developed and ready to emerge. They may remain resting during this period until they receive a signal that a host is near - vibrations (including sound), heat, and carbon dioxide are all stimuli indicating the probable presence of a host. Fleas are known to overwinter in the larval or pupal stages.\n",
    "References": "",
    "Relationship with host": "Fleas feed on a wide variety of warm-blooded vertebrates including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. The chigoe flea or jigga (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world.\n",
    "Relationship with humans": "Approximately $2.8 billion is spent annually on flea-related veterinarian bills and another $1.6 billion annually for flea treatment with pet groomers. Four billion dollars is spent annually for prescription flea treatment and $348 million for flea pest control. Besides just economic costs to control fleas as pests, fleas provide some ecosystem services (benefits from ecosystems that support human life and well-being). Flea larvae feed on organic debris and increase the surface area of particulate matter to assist in decomposition.\nFleas have featured in poems and other literature, music, and art, and in flea circuses have provided entertainment. These circuses, extremely popular in Europe from 1830 onwards, featured fleas dressed as humans or towing miniature carts, chariots, rollers or cannon. These devices were originally made by watchmakers or jewellers to show off their skill at miniaturization. A ringmaster called a \"professor\" accompanied their performance with a rapid circus patter.\nFleas are seen as a bioterrorism weapon as they carry Yersinia pestis. The infected fleas feed on rodents which then infect the human population with the plague. During World War II, the Japanese army dropped fleas infested with Y. pestis in China. The bubonic and septicaemic plague are the most probable form of the plague that would spread as a result of a bioterrorism attack that used fleas as a vector.\nThe banker Charles Rothschild devoted much of his time to entomology, creating a large collection of fleas now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum, London. He discovered and named the plague vector flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, also known as the oriental rat flea, in 1903. Using what was probably the world's most complete collection of fleas of about 260,000 specimens (representing some 73% of the 2,587 species and subspecies so far described), he described around 500 species and subspecies of Siphonaptera. He was followed in this interest by his daughter Miriam Rothschild, who helped to catalogue his enormous collection of the insects in seven volumes.\n",

    "Taxonomy and phylogeny": "In the past, it was most commonly supposed that fleas had evolved from the flies (Diptera), based on similarities of the larvae. Genetic and morphological evidence indicates that the Siphonaptera are descendants of the Mecoptera (scorpionfly) family Boreidae, which are also flightless; accordingly, they may eventually be reclassified as a suborder within the Mecoptera.\nFossils of wingless \"pre-fleas\" with siphonate mouthparts from the middle Jurassic to early Cretaceous have been found in northeastern China. These belonged to three proposed extinct families, the Pseudopulicidae, the Saurophthiridae, and the Tarwiniidae. The last common ancestor of modern Siphonaptera separated from the Mecoptera during the early Cretaceous. Most flea families formed after the end of the Cretaceous (in the Paleogene and onwards). Fleas probably arose in the southern continental area of Gondwana, and migrated rapidly northwards from there. They most likely evolved with mammal and marsupial hosts, only later moving to birds and monotremes.\nTheir evolution continued to produce adaptations for their specialized parasitic niche, such that they now have no wings and their eyes are covered over. The large number of flea species may be attributed to the wide variety of host species on which they feed, which provides so many specific ecological niches to which to adapt. In any case, all these groups seem to represent a clade of closely related insect lineages, for which the names Mecopteroidea and Antliophora have been proposed.\nFlea systematics are not entirely fixed. While compared to many other insect groups, fleas have been studied and classified fairly thoroughly, details still remain to be learned about the evolutionary relationships among the different flea lineages.\nSuborder Pulicomorpha\nSuperfamily Pulicoidea\nFamily Hectopsyllidae—sticktight and chigoe fleas (\"jiggers\" of Latin America)\nFamily Pulicidae—common fleas\nSuperfamily Malacopsylloidea\nFamily Malacopsyllidae\nFamily Rhopalopsyllidae—hosts\nFamily Vermipsyllidae—hosts: carnivores\nSuperfamily Coptopsylloidea\nFamily Coptopsyllidae\nSuperfamily Ancistropsylloidea\nFamily Ancistropsyllidae\nSuborder Pygiopsyllomorpha\nSuperfamily Pygiopsylloidea\nFamily Lycopsyllidae\nFamily Pygiopsyllidae\nFamily Stivaliidae\nSuborder Hystrichopsyllomorpha\nSuperfamily Hystrichopsylloidea\nFamily Hystrichopsyllidae—hosts: rats and mice, includes Ctenopsyllidae, Amphipsyllidae\nFamily Chimaeropsyllidae\nSuperfamily Macropsylloidea\nFamily Macropsyllidae\nSuperfamily Stephanocircidoidea\nFamily Stephanocircidae\nSuborder Ceratophyllomorpha\nSuperfamily Ceratophylloidea\nFamily Ceratophyllidae\n"
