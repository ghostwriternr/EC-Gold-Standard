    "Behaviour and ecology": "True limpets in the family Patellidae live on hard surfaces in the intertidal zone. Unlike barnacles or mussels, true limpets are capable of locomotion instead of being permanently attached to a single spot. However, when they need to resist strong wave action or other disturbances, limpets cling extremely strongly to the hard surface on which they live, using their muscular foot to apply suction combined with the effect of adhesive mucus. It often is very difficult to remove a true limpet from a rock without injuring or killing it.\nAll \"true\" limpets are marine and have gills. However, because the adaptive feature of a simple conical shell has repeatedly arisen independently in gastropod evolution, limpets from many different evolutionary lineages occur in widely different environments. Some saltwater limpets such as Trimusculidae breathe air, and some freshwater limpets are descendents of air-breathing land snails (e.g. the genus Ancylus) whose ancestors had a pallial cavity serving as a lung. In these small freshwater limpets, that \"lung\" underwent secondary adaptation to allow the absorption of dissolved oxygen from water.\n",
    "In culture and literature": "Limpet mines are a type of naval mine attached to a target by magnets. They are named after the tenacious grip of the limpet.\nThe humorous author Edward Lear wrote \"Cheer up, as the limpet said to the weeping willow\" in one of his letters. Simon Grindle wrote the 1964 illustrated children's book of nonsense poetry The Loving Limpet and Other Peculiarities, said to be \"in the great tradition of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll\".\n",
    "Naming": "The common name \"limpet\" also is applied to a number of not very closely related groups of sea snails and freshwater snails (aquatic gastropod mollusks). Thus the common name \"limpet\" has very little taxonomic significance in and of itself; the name is applied not only to true limpets (the Patellogastropoda), but also to all snails that have a simple shell that is broadly conical in shape, and either is not spirally coiled, or appears not to be coiled in the adult snail. In other words, the shell of all limpets is \"patelliform\", which means the shell is shaped more or less like the shell of most true limpets. The term \"false limpets\" is used for some (but not all) of these other groups that have a conical shell.\nThus, the name limpet is used to describe various extremely diverse groups of gastropods that have independently evolved a shell of the same basic shape (see convergent evolution). And although the name \"limpet\" is given on the basis of a limpet-like or \"patelliform\" shell, the several groups of snails that have a shell of this type are not at all closely related to one another.\n",
    "Other limpets": "Marine\nThe hydrothermal vent limpets – Neomphaloidea and Lepetodriloidea\nThe hoof snails – Hipponix and other Hipponicidae\nSlipper snails – Crepidula species, which are sometimes known as slipper limpets\nFreshwater\nThe pulmonate river and lake limpets – Ancylidae\nMost marine limpets have gills, whereas all freshwater limpets and a few marine limpets have a mantle cavity adapted to breathe air and function as a lung (and in some cases again adapted to absorb oxygen from water). All these kinds of snail are only very distantly related.\n",
    "Phylogeny": "Gastropods that have limpet-like or patelliform shells are found in several different clades:\nClade Patellogastropoda, example Patellidae, the true limpets, all marine, in five living families and two fossil families\nClade Vetigastropoda, examples Fissurellidae, (the keyhole limpets and slit limpets), and Lepetelloidea, small deepwater limpets\nClade Neritimorpha, example Phenacolepadidae, small limpets related to nerites\nClade Heterobranchia, group Opisthobranchia, example Tylodinidae, the umbrella slugs with a limpet-shaped shell\nClade Heterobranchia, group Pulmonata, examples Siphonariidae, Latiidae, Trimusculidae, all air-breathing limpets\n",

    "Teeth": "The teeth of limpets, like those of all molluscs, make up an organ called a radula which consist of composite nanostructures with fractions of reinforcing goethite nanofibres within a softer chitin matrix to provide mechanical integrity. A 2015 study into the tensile strength of teeth from Patella vulgata found ranges from 3.0 to 6.5 gigapascals (GPa), making them the strongest known biological material, outperforming spider silk. The mineral protein of the limpet teeth can withstand a tensile stress of 4.9 GPa, compared to 4 GPa of spider silk and 0.5 GPa of human teeth. This strength is attributed to a high mineral volume fraction of goethite nanofibres. Durable artificial structures derived from limpet teeth may have applications in high-performance engineering, such as aircraft fuselages and the bodies of Formula 1 racing cars.\n"
