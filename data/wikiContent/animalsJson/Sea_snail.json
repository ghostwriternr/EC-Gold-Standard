    "2005 taxonomy": "The following cladogram is an overview of the main clades of living gastropods based on the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), with taxa that contain saltwater or brackish water species marked in boldface (some of the highlighted taxa consist entirely of marine species, but some of them also contain freshwater or land species.)\nClade Patellogastropoda\nClade Vetigastropoda\nClade Cocculiniformia\nClade Neritimorpha\nClade Cycloneritimorpha\nClade Caenogastropoda\nInformal group Architaenioglossa\nClade Sorbeoconcha\nClade Hypsogastropoda\nClade Littorinimorpha\nInformal group Ptenoglossa\nClade Neogastropoda\nClade Heterobranchia\nInformal group Lower Heterobranchia\nInformal group Opisthobranchia\nClade Cephalaspidea\nClade Thecosomata\nClade Gymnosomata\nClade Aplysiomorpha\nGroup Acochlidiacea\nClade Sacoglossa\nGroup Cylindrobullida\nClade Umbraculida\nClade Nudipleura\nClade Pleurobranchomorpha\nClade Nudibranchia\nClade Euctenidiacea\nClade Dexiarchia\nClade Pseudoeuctenidiacea\nClade Cladobranchia\nClade Euarminida\nClade Dendronotida\nClade Aeolidida\nInformal group Pulmonata\nInformal group Basommatophora\nClade Eupulmonata\nClade Systellommatophora\nClade Stylommatophora\nClade Elasmognatha\nClade Orthurethra\nInformal group Sigmurethra\n",
    "Anatomy": "Sea snails are a very large group of animals and a very diverse one. Most snails that live in saltwater respire using a gill or gills, a few species, though, have a lung, are intertidal, and are active only at low tide when they can move around in the air. These air-breathing species include false limpets in the family Siphonariidae and another group of false limpets in the family Trimusculidae.\nMany, but not all sea snails have an operculum.\n",
    "Definition": "Determining whether some gastropods should be called sea snails is not always easy. Some species that live in brackish water (such as certain neritids) can be listed as either freshwater snails or marine snails, and some species that live at or just above the high tide level (for example species in the genus Truncatella) are sometimes considered to be sea snails and sometimes listed as land snails.\n",
    "Human uses": "A number of species of sea snails are used by humans for food, including abalone, conch, limpets, whelks (such as the North American Busycon species and the North Atlantic Buccinum undatum) and periwinkles including Littorina littorea.\nThe shells of sea snails are often found by humans as seashells commonly wash up on beaches. Because the shells of many sea snails are attractive and durable, they have been used by humans to make necklaces and other jewelry from prehistoric times to the current day.\nThe shells of a few species of large sea snails within the Vetigastropoda have a thick layer of nacre and have been used as a source of mother of pearl. Historically, the button industry relied on these species for a number of years.\n",
    "See also": "Freshwater snail\nLand snail\nSea slug\nSlug\n",
    "Shells": "The shells of most species of sea snails are spirally coiled. Some, though, have conical shells, and these are often referred to by the common name of limpets. In one unusual family (Juliidae), the shell of the snail has become two hinged plates closely resembling those of a bivalve; this family is sometimes called the \"bivalved gastropods\".\nTheir shells are found in a variety of shapes and sizes, but are normally very small. Those of living species of sea snails range in size from Syrinx aruanus, the largest living shelled gastropod species at 91 cm, to minute species whose shells are less than 1 mm at adult size. Because the shells of sea snails are strong and durable in many cases, as a group they are well represented in the fossil record.\n",
    "Taxonomy": "",
    "Use by other animals": "The shells of sea snails are used for protection by many kinds of hermit crabs. A hermit crab carries the shell by grasping the central columella of the shell using claspers on the tip of its abdomen.\n"
