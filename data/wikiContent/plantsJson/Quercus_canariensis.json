    "Landmark specimens": "The picture to the left is of a grand old Algerian oak tree that was planted on 19 May 1863. It resides within the Kyneton Botanical Gardens in the town of Kyneton in the Australian state of Victoria. This tree is listed by the National Trust on the Register of Significant Trees in Victoria. There are also two good specimens located in the Ballarat Botanical Gardens, one of which is believed to have been planted in 1920. There was another significant old Algerian oak tree in Victoria at the Melbourne Royal Botanic Gardens. It was known as Lady Loch's Oak - however its trunk split in half in November 2007, due to the weight of its giant old limbs. The tree has been extensively planted in Canberra.\n",
