    "Butterfly attractant for enhancing gardens": "Butterflies are attracted to Rudbeckia hirta when planted in large color-masses, creating a beautiful spectacle.\n",
    "Cautions": "As with any wild plant, it is usually recommended to research carefully before consuming as not all parts of the plant may be edible and to avoid mis-identification with other plants that may look similar to the Black eyed Susan.\nIt is widely recommended always to consult one's doctor before taking any medicinal herb.\nWith any herb approved by a doctor for use, it is widely agreed that recommended dosages and preparation procedures should always be followed.\nThe species is also known to be toxic to cats when ingested.\n",
    "Cultivation": "Rudbeckia hirta is widely cultivated in parks and gardens, for summer bedding schemes, borders, containers, wildflower gardens, prairie-style plantings and cut flowers. Numerous cultivars have been developed, of which 'Indian Summer' and 'Toto' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Other popular cultivars include 'Double Gold' and 'Marmalade'.\nGloriosa daisies are tetraploid cultivars having much larger flower heads than the wild species, often doubled or with contrasting markings on the ray florets. They were first bred by Alfred Blakeslee of Smith College by applying colchicine to R. hirta seeds; Blakeslee's stock was further developed by W. Atlee Burpee and introduced to commerce at the 1957 Philadelphia Flower Show. Gloriosa daisies are generally treated as annuals or short-lived perennials and are typically grown from seed, though there are some named cultivars.\n",
    "Description": "Rudbeckia hirta is an upright annual (sometimes biennial or perennial) growing 30–100 cm (12–39 in) tall by 30–45 cm (12–18 in) wide. It has alternate, mostly basal leaves 10–18 cm long, covered by coarse hair, with stout branching stems and daisy-like, composite flower heads appearing in late summer and early autumn. In the species, the flowers are up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter, with yellow ray florets circling conspicuous brown or black, dome-shaped cone of many small disc florets. However, extensive breeding has produced a range of sizes and colours, including oranges, reds and browns.\n",
    "Etymology": "The genus name honors Olaus Rudbeck, who was a professor of botany at the University of Uppsala in Sweden and was one of Linnaeus's teachers. The specific epithet refers to the trichomes (hairs) occurring on leaves and stems.\n",

    "Maryland state flower": "The black-eyed Susan was designated the state flower of Maryland in 1918. In this capacity it is used in gardens and ceremonies to celebrate, memorialize and show affection for the state of Maryland and its people.\nThe Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, Maryland, has been termed \"The Run for the Black-Eyed Susans\" because a blanket of Viking Poms, a variety of Chrysanthemums resembling Black-eyed Susans, is traditionally placed around the winning horse's neck (actual Black-eyed Susans are not in bloom in May during the Preakness).\n",
    "Nutritional parts": "Certain parts of the plant contains anthocyanins a class of antioxidant with several known health benefits.\n",
    "References": "",
    "Symbol of Justice": "The black-eyed Susan which also traditionally symbolizes “Justice” makes a very nice cut-flower with a vase life up to 10 days.\n",
    "Symbolism and uses": "",
    "Traditional Native American medicinal uses": "The roots but not the seedheads of Rudbeckia hirta can be used much like the related Echinacea purpurea to boost immunity and fight colds, flu and infections.\nIt is also an astringent when used in a warm infusion as a wash for sores and swellings.\nThe Ojibwa people used it as a poultice for snake bites and to make an infusion for treating colds and worms in children.\nThe plant is also diuretic and was used by the Menominee and Potawatomi peoples.\nJuice from the roots has been used as drops for earaches.\n",
    "University of Southern Mississippi": "In 1912, the black-eyed Susan became the inspiration for the University of Southern Mississippi school colors (black and gold), suggested by Florence Burrow Pope, a member of the university's first graduating class. According to Pope: “On a trip home, I saw great masses of Black-Eyed Susans in the pine forests. I decided to encourage my senior class to gather Black-Eyed Susans to spell out the name of the class on sheets to be displayed during exercises on Class Day. I then suggested black and gold as class colors, and my suggestion was adopted.\"\n",
    "Varieties": "There are four varieties\nRudbeckia hirta var. angustifolia - southeastern + south-central United States (South Carolina to Texas)\nRudbeckia hirta var. floridana - Florida\nRudbeckia hirta var. hirta - Eastern United States (Maine to Alabama).\nRudbeckia hirta var. pulcherrima. Widespread in most of North America (Newfoundland to British Columbia, south to Alabama and New Mexico; naturalized Washington to California).\n"
