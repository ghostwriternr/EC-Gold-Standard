Hermes met with Odysseus and gave him a drug called moly, a resistance to Circeâ€™s magic. Circe, being attracted to Odysseus' resistance, fell in love with him. Circe released his men. Odysseus and his crew remained with her on the island for one year, while they feasted and drank. Finally, Odysseus' men convinced Odysseus that it was time to leave for Ithaca.\nformerly included\nAllium moly var. ambiguum, now called Allium roseum\nAllium moly subsp. massaessylum, now called Allium massaessylum\nAllium moly var. stamineum, now called Allium stamineum\nAllium moly var. xericiense, now called Allium scorzonerifolium\n"
