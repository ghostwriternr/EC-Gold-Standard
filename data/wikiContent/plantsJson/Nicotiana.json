    "Cultivation": "Several species of Nicotiana, such as N. sylvestris, N. alata 'Lime Green' and N. langsdorffii are grown as ornamental plants, often under the name of Flowering Tobacco. They are popular vespertines (evening bloomers), their sweet-smelling flowers opening in the evening to be visited by hawkmoths and other pollinators. In temperate climates they behave as annuals (Hardiness 9a-11). The hybrid cultivars Domino Series  and 'Lime Green' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nGarden varieties are derived from N. alata (e.g. 'Niki' and 'Saratoga' series) and more recently from Nicotiana x sanderae (e.g. 'Perfume' and 'Domino' series).\n",
    "Ecology": "Despite containing enough nicotine and/or other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores, a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species and therefore some tobacco plants (chiefly Tree Tobacco, N. glauca) have become established as invasive species in some places.\nIn the nineteenth century, young tobacco plantings came under increasing attack from flea beetles (Epitrix cucumeris and/or Epitrix pubescens), causing destruction of half the United States tobacco crop in 1876. In the years afterward, many experiments were attempted and discussed to control the flea beetle. By 1880, it was discovered that replacing the branches with a frame covered by thin fabric would effectively protect plants from the beetle. This practice spread until it became ubiquitous in the 1890s.\nLepidoptera whose caterpillars feed on Nicotiana include:\nDark Sword-grass or Black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon\nTurnip Moth, Agrotis segetum\nMouse Moth, Amphipyra tragopoginis\nThe Nutmeg, Discestra trifolii\nEndoclita excrescens\nBlackburn's Sphinx Moth, Manduca blackburni\nTobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta\nTomato Hornworm, Manduca quinquemaculata\nCabbage Moth, Mamestra brassicae\nAngle Shades, Phlogophora meticulosa\nSetaceous Hebrew Character, Xestia c-nigrum\nThese are mainly Noctuidae and some Sphingidae.\n",
    "Etymology": "The word nicotiana (as well as nicotine) was named in honor of Jean Nicot, French ambassador to Portugal, who in 1559 sent it as a medicine to the court of Catherine de' Medici.\n",
    "Formerly placed here": "Petunia axillaris (Lam.) Britton et al. (as N. axillaris Lam.)\n",
    "Manmade hybrids": "Nicotiana × didepta N. debneyi × N. tabacum\nNicotiana × digluta N. glutinosa × N. tabacum\nNicotiana × sanderae Hort. ex Wats. N. alata × N. forgetiana\n",
