    "Description": "Quercus coccinea is a medium-large deciduous tree growing to 20–30 m (67–100 feet) tall with an open, rounded crown.\nThe leaves are glossy green, 7–17 cm (2.8-6.8 inches) long and 8–13 cm (3.2-5.2 inches) broad, lobed, with seven lobes, and deep sinuses between the lobes. Each lobe has 3-7 bristle-tipped teeth. The leaf is hairless (unlike the related pin oak, which has tufts of pale orange-brown down where the lobe veins join the central vein). The common English name is derived from the autumn coloration of the foliage, which generally becomes bright scarlet; in contrast, pin oak foliage generally turns bronze in autumn.\nThe acorns are ovoid, 7–13 mm broad and 17–31 mm long, a third to a half covered in a deep cup, green maturing pale brown about 18 months after pollination; the kernel is very bitter.\n",

    "Uses": "Scarlet oak is sometimes planted as an ornamental tree, popular for its bright red fall color, although the tree is less commonly seen in cultivation than Q. rubra (the northern red oak) and Q. palustris (pin oak). The cultivar 'Splendens' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nThe wood is generally marketed as red oak, but is of inferior quality, being somewhat weaker and not forming as large a tree.\n"
