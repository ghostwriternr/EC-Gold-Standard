    "Species": "Cercis comprises the following species:\nOld World\nCercis chinensis Bunge—Chinese redbud (East Asia)\nCercis chingii Chun—Ching's redbud (China)\nCercis chuniana F.P.Metcalf (China)\nCercis glabra Pamp.—Yunnan redbud (China)\nCercis griffithii Boiss.—Afghan redbud (southern central Asia)\nCercis hebecarpa (Bornm.) Ponert\nCercis racemosa Oliv.—chain-flowered redbud (western China)\nCercis siliquastrum L.—Judas tree or European redbud (Mediterranean region)\nNew World\nCercis canadensis L. – eastern redbud (eastern North America)\nCercis mexicana Rose – Mexican redbud (northeast Mexico and Texas(Trans-Pecos) )\nCercis reniformis Engl. – Oklahoma redbud (Oklahoma and Texas(East of the Pecos River) )\nCercis occidentalis Torr. ex A. Gray – western redbud (Western United States)\nThe Judas tree (Cercis siliquastrum) is a small tree to 10–15 m tall native to the south of Europe and southwest Asia, in Iberia, southern France, Italy, Bulgaria, Greece and Asia Minor, which forms a handsome low tree with a flat spreading head. In early spring it is covered with a profusion of magenta pink flowers, which appear before the leaves. The flowers have an agreeably acidic bite, and are eaten in mixed salad or made into fritters. The tree frequently figured in the 16th and 17th century herbals.\nThis small, sparsely branched tree is said to be the one from which Judas Iscariot hanged himself after betraying Christ, but the name may derive from \"Judea's tree\", after the region encompassing Israel and Palestine where the tree is commonplace.\nA smaller Eastern American woodland understory tree, the eastern redbud, Cercis canadensis, is common from southernmost Canada to Piedmont, Alabama and East Texas. It differs from C. siliquastrum in its pointed leaves and slightly smaller size (rarely over 12 m tall). The flowers are also used in salads and for making pickled relish, while the inner bark of twigs gives a mustard-yellow dye.\nThe related western redbud, Cercis occidentalis, ranges from California east to Utah primarily in foothill regions. Its leaves are more rounded at the tip than the relatively heart-shaped leaves of the eastern redbud. The tree often forms multi-trunked colonies that are covered in bright pink flowers in early spring (February - March). White-flowered variants are in cultivation. It buds only once a year.\nThe chain-flowered redbud (Cercis racemosa) from western China is unusual in the genus in having its flowers in pendulous 10 cm (4 in) racemes, as in a Laburnum, rather than short clusters.\n",

    "Wood": "The wood is medium weight, somewhat brittle, of light tan color with a noticeably large heartwood area of darker brown, tinged with red. The wood has attractive figuring and is used in wood turning, for making decorative items and in the production of wood veneer.\n"
