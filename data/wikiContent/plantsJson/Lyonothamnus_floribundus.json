    "Description": "Lyonothamnus is endemic to the Channel Islands of California, where it grows in the chaparral and oak woodlands of the rocky coastal canyons.\nThis is a tree growing up to 15 metres (49 ft) tall with peeling reddish gray or brown bark.

    "Subspecies": "There are two subspecies which are different in morphology.\nssp. aspleniifolius is the more common, and has leaves made up of linear leaflets which are divided into rectangular segments.\nssp. floribundus is limited to Catalina Island, has smooth-edged leaves not divided into any leaflets or segments.\n",
    "Systematics": "Lyonothamnus is currently a geographically restricted island endemic genus containing one species with two subspecies. Discoveries of fossils have suggested that the genus once comprised several species, all but one now extinct, which grew on the mainland in the southwestern United States.\n"
