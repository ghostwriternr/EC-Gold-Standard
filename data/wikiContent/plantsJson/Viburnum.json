    "Cultivation and uses": "Many species of viburnum have become popular as garden or landscape plants because of their showy flowers and berries, fragrance, and good autumn colour of some forms. Some popular species, hybrids, and cultivars include:\nThe hybrid Viburnum × bodnantense (V. farreri × V. grandiflorum) is particularly popular for its strongly scented pink flowers on the leafless deciduous shoots in mid- to late winter.\nViburnum × burkwoodii (V. carlesii × V. utile)\nViburnum × carlcephallum (V. carlesii × V. macrocephalum)\nViburnum carlesii has round white flowerheads, strong fragrance, dense structure, and reddish leaves in autumn.\nViburnum davidii is an evergreen species from China with blue fruit.\nViburnum dentatum has flat-topped flowers, bluish fruit, and reddish leaves in autumn. It is somewhat salt-tolerant. The cultivar 'Blue Muffin' is more compact than the species and has fruit that are a deeper blue than the species.\nViburnum dilatatum has flat-topped flowers, reddish leaves in autumn, and bright red fruit that persist into winter.\nV. × jackii – Jack's viburnum\nViburnum × juddii (V. bitchiuense × V. carlesii)\nViburnum plicatum has white flowers, textured leaves, reddish-black fruit, and can grow quite large under ideal conditions. The species can tolerate shade, but not drought.\nViburnum × pragense (V. rhytidophyllum × V. utile)\nViburnum × rhytidophylloides (V. lantana × V. rhytidophyllum)\nViburnum rhytidophyllum is a popular evergreen species, grown mainly for its foliage effect of large, dark green leathery leaves with strongly wrinkled surface. This is the parent species of two popular hybrid cultivars known as 'Alleghany' and 'Pragense'. 'Alleghany' was selected from a hybrid between V. rhytidophyllum and V. lantana 'Mohican' (in 1958, at the US National Arboretum).\nViburnum setigerum has upright, coarse structure and orange to reddish-orange fruit.\nViburnum sieboldii has coarse, open structure, flat-topped flowers, reddish-black fruit, and can grow as a small tree.\nViburnum tinus is a widely grown garden and landscape shrub.\n",
