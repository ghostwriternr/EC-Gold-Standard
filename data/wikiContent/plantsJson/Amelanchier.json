    "Ecology": "Amelanchier plants are preferred browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of such Lepidoptera as Brimstone Moth, Brown-tail, Grey Dagger, Mottled Umber, Rough Prominent, The Satellite, Winter Moth, and the Red-Spotted Purple and the White Admiral (both Limenitis arthemis), as well as various other herbivorous insects feed on Amelanchier. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and Gymnosporangium rust. In years when late flowers of Amelanchier overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial fireblight.\n",
    "Etymology": "The origin of the generic name Amelanchier is probably derived from amalenquièr, amelanchièr, the Provençal names of the European Amelanchier ovalis.\nThe name serviceberry comes from the similarity of the fruit to the related European Sorbus.\nA fanciful etymology explains the name 'serviceberry' by noting that the flowers bloom about the time roads in the Appalachian mountains became passable, allowing circuit-riding preachers to resume church services. A similar etymology says that blooming serviceberry indicated the ground had thawed enough to dig graves, so burial services could be held for those who died in the winter when the only way to deal with the bodies was to allow them to freeze and wait for spring. Both of these fanciful etymologies are unlikely to be correct since the term is attested for both English and New World species as early as the 16th century, well before settlement of English North America, and serviceberry is far from unique in blossoming early in the year.\nJuneberry refers to the fruits of certain species becoming ripe in June. The name saskatoon originated from a Cree noun misâskwatômina (misāskwatōmina, misaaskwatoomina) for Amelanchier alnifolia. The city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan is named after this plant.\nShadberry refers to the shad runs in certain New England streams, which generally took place about when the trees bloomed.\n",
    "Garden history": "Several species are very popular ornamental shrubs, grown for their flowers, bark, and fall color. All need similar conditions to grow well, requiring good drainage, air circulation (to discourage leaf diseases), watering during drought, and soil appropriate for the species.\nGeorge Washington planted specimens of Amelanchier on the grounds of his estate, Mount Vernon, in Virginia.\n",

    "Selected species": "For North American species, the taxonomy follows the Flora of North America; for Asian species the Flora of China; and for European species the Flora Europaea.\nAmelanchier alnifolia - Saskatoon serviceberry, alder-leaved shadbush, saskatoon, saskatoon berry, amélanchier à feuilles d'aulne\nAmelanchier amabilis - Lovely shadbush, amélanchier gracieux \nAmelanchier arborea - Downy shadbush\nAmelanchier australis -\nAmelanchier bartramiana - Mountain shadbush, amélanchier de Bartram \nAmelanchier canadensis - Eastern shadbush, amélanchier du Canada\nAmelanchier humilis - Low shadbush, amélanchier bas\nAmelanchier interior - Wiegand's shadbush, amélanchier de l'intérieur\nAmelanchier laevis - Smooth shadbush, Allegheny serviceberry, amélanchier glabre\nAmelanchier nantucketensis - Nantucket serviceberry\nAmelanchier ovalis - Snowy Mespilus\nAmelanchier sanguinea - Red-twigged shadbush, amélanchier sanguin\nAmelanchier sinica - Chinese Serviceberry\nAmelanchier spicata - Thicket shadbush, amélanchier en épis\nAmelanchier utahensis - Utah serviceberry\nSince classifications have varied greatly over the past century, species names are often used interchangeably in the nursery trade. Several natural or horticultural hybrids also exist, and many A. arborea and A. canadensis plants that are offered for sale are actually hybrids, or entirely different species.\nA taxon called Amelanchier lamarckii (or A. x lamarckii) is very widely cultivated and naturalized in Europe, where it was introduced in the 17th century. It is apomictic, breeding true from seed, and probably of hybrid origin, perhaps descending from a cross between A. laevis and either A. arborea or A. canadensis. While A. lamarckii is known to be of North American origin, probably from eastern Canada, it is not known to occur naturally in the wild in North America.\n",
    "Uses and cultivation": "The fruit of several species are excellent to eat raw, tasting somewhat like a blueberry, strongly accented by the almond-like flavour of the seeds. Selections from Amelanchier alnifolia have been chosen for fruit production, with several named cultivars. Other cultivars appear to be derived from hybridization between A. alnifolia and A. stolonifera. Propagation is by seed, divisions, and grafting. Serviceberries graft so readily that grafts onto other genera, such as Crataegus and Sorbus, are often successful.\nFruit is harvested locally for pies and jams. The saskatoon berry is harvested commercially. One version of the Native American food pemmican was flavored by serviceberry fruits in combination with minced dried meat and fat.\nThe wood is brown, hard, close-grained, and heavy. The heartwood is reddish-brown, and the sapwood is lighter in color. It can be used for tool handles and fishing rods. Native Americans used it for arrow shafts. Members of the Pit River Tribe would use the wood to create a sort of body armor, crafting it into a heavy robe or overcoat and corset armor worn during fighting.\n"
