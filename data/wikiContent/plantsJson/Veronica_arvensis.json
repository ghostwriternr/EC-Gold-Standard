    "Growth": "V. arvensis plants go through changes in their germination due to temperature and light, furthermore explaining what controls the timing of growth in buried seed reserves. These weeds tend to germinate in consistent temperature ranges of 10 degrees Celsius to 15 degrees Celsius. If they do not make the first autumn cycle of growth, they can grow in the following spring. Overall, light is a major source to their survival and growth. In other words, they can grow in darkness, however they will remain dormant unless they get light.\n",
