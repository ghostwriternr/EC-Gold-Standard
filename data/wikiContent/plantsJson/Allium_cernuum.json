    "Description": "Allium cernuum has an unsheathed slender conical bulb which gradually tapers directly into several keeled grass-like leaves (2–4 mm, 3⁄32–5⁄32 in wide).\nEach mature bulb bears a single flowering stem, which terminates in a downward nodding umbel of white or rose flowers. Flowers appear in July or August. They are bell-shaped, about 5 mm (3⁄16 in) across, pink or white with yellow pollen and yellow anthers. This plant does not have bulblets in the inflorescence.\nThe flowers mature into spherical crested fruits which later split open to reveal the dark shiny seeds.\n",
