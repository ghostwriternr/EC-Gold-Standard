    "Cultivation": "Nephrolepis obliterata prefer bright, but indirect sunlight. Temperatures between 60 °F and 75 °F are best. Nephrolepis obliterata is sensitive to both too little and too much water, so water the plant well but permit the soil to dry out between waterings.\nNephrolepis obliterata has the added benefit of reducing indoor air pollution, particularly formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene.\n"
