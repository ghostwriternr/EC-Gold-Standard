    "Cultivation and uses": "B. oleracea has become established as an important human food crop plant, used because of its large food reserves, which are stored over the winter in its leaves. It is rich in essential nutrients including vitamin C. A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (e.g., cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower) is linked to a reduced risk of several human cancers.\nAlthough it is believed to have been cultivated for several thousand years, its history as a domesticated plant is not clear before Greek and Roman times, when it was a well-established garden vegetable. Theophrastus mentions three kinds of rhaphanos (ῤάφανος): a curly-leaved, a smooth-leaved, and a wild-type. He reports the antipathy of the cabbage and the grape vine, for the ancients believed cabbages grown near grapes would impart their flavour to the wine. It has been bred into a wide range of cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, collards, and kale, some of which are hardly recognisable as being members of the same genus, let alone species. The historical genus of Crucifera, meaning \"cross-bearing,\" may be the only unifying feature beyond taste.\n",
    "History": "With the advent of agriculture and the domestication of wild crop plants, the peoples of the Mediterranean began cultivating wild cabbage. Through artificial selection for various phenotype traits the emergence of variations of the plant with drastic differences in looks took only a few thousand years. Preference for leaves, terminal bud, lateral bud, stem and inflorescence evolved the wild cabbage into the many forms we know today.\n",
    "Impact of Preference": "The preference for the eating of the leaves led to the selection of plants with larger leaves being harvested and their seeds planted for the next growth. Around the 5th century BC the formation of what we now know as kale had developed.\nPreference led to further artificial selection of kale plants with more tightly bunched leaves, or terminal bud. Somewhere around the 1st century AD emerged the phenotype variation of Brassica oleracea that we know as cabbage.\nPhenotype selection preferences in Germany led kale down another evolutionary pathway. By selecting for fatter stems the variant plant known as kohlrabi emerged around the 1st century AD.\nFurther selection in Belgium in lateral bud led to the Brussels sprout in the 18th century.\nEuropean preference emerged for eating immature buds, selection for inflorescence. By the 15th century AD cauliflower had developed leading also to the emergence of broccoli in Italy about 100 years later.\n",
    "Origins": "According to the Triangle of U theory, B. oleracea is very closely related to five other species of the genus Brassica.\nThe cultivars of B. oleracea are grouped by developmental form into seven major cultivar groups, of which the Acephala (\"non-heading\") group remains most like the natural Wild Cabbage in appearance:\nBrassica oleracea Acephala Group – kale and collard greens\nBrassica oleracea Alboglabra Group – Chinese broccoli or Kai-lan\nBrassica oleracea Botrytis Group – cauliflower, Romanesco broccoli and broccoflower\nBrassica oleracea Capitata Group – cabbage\nBrassica oleracea Gemmifera Group – brussels sprouts\nBrassica oleracea Gongylodes Group – kohlrabi\nBrassica oleracea Italica Group – broccoli\nIn places such as the Channel Islands and Canary Islands where the frost is minimal and plants are thus freed from seasonality, some cultivars, known as Jersey cabbages, can grow up to three meters tall. These \"tree cabbages\" yield fresh leaves throughout the year, are perennial, and do not need to be destroyed at harvest as with a normal cabbage. Their woody stalks are sometimes dried and made into walking sticks.\n",
