    "History": "In 2014 it was claimed that Alexander the Great could have been poisoned by a wine made from Veratrum album. Previously it was believed that poisoning due to arsenic or (a mythical belief) the water of the river Styx may have led to the death of the King of Macedon.\nIn antiquity, an effective emetic based on white hellebore and a bitter oval seed (which Hahneman believed was the seed of Erigeron or Senecio) was mixed by the physicians of Antikyra, a city of Phocis in Greece.\n",
    "Plant description": "The plant is a perennial herb with a stout vertical rhizome covered with remnants of old leaf sheaths. The stout, simple stems are 50 to 175 cm tall. They have been mistaken for yellow gentian, Gentiana lutea, which is used in beverages, resulting in poisoning.\nResveratrol has been isolated from the plant.\nProtoveratrine is the name of an alkaloid extracted from Veratrum album that has been claimed to have use in the treatment of hypertension.\n",
    "References": "",
    "Uses": "The root is very poisonous, with a paralyzing effect on the nervous system. In two cases of fatal poisoning from eating the seeds, the toxins veratridine and cevadine were present in the blood. In 1983 sneezing powders produced from the herb in West Germany were reported to have caused severe intoxications in Scandinavia.\n"
