    "Ecology": "Baobabs are important as nest sites for birds, in particular the mottled spinetail and four species of weaver.\n",
    "Food uses": "Since 2008, interest has been increasing for developing baobab seeds or dried fruit powder for consumer products. In the European Union (EU) prior to commercial approval, baobab fruit powder was not available for ingredient uses, as legislation from 1997 dictated that foods not commonly consumed in the EU would have to be formally approved first. In 2008, baobab dried fruit pulp was authorized in the EU as a safe food ingredient, and it was later granted GRAS status in the United States.\nThe fruit has a velvety shell and is about the size of a coconut, weighing about 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb). It has an acidic, tart flavor, described as \"somewhere between grapefruit, pear, and vanilla\". The fresh fruit is said to taste like sherbet.\nThe dried fruit powder of A. digitata contains about 12% water and modest levels of various nutrients, including carbohydrates, pectin, riboflavin, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, and phytosterols, with low levels of protein and fats. Vitamin C content, described as variable in different samples, was in a range of 74–163 mg per 100 g of dried powder.\nThe powdery white interior may be used as a \"thickener in jams and gravies, a sweetener for fruit drinks, or a tangy flavor addition to hot sauces\". The fruit pulp and seeds of A. grandidieri and A. za are eaten fresh. In Tanzania, the dry pulp of A. digitata is added to sugar cane to aid fermentation in beermaking. The seeds of some species are a source of vegetable oil and leaves may be eaten as a leaf vegetable.\nIn Angola, the dry fruit is usually boiled and the broth is used for juices or as the base for a type of ice cream known as gelado de múcua. In Zimbabwe, the fruit is used in traditional food preparations which include \"eating the fruit fresh or crushed crumbly pulp to stir into porridge and drinks\". Malawi women have set up commercial ventures harvesting the baobab to earn their children's school fees.\n",

    "Habitat": "The Malagasy species are important components of the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. Within that biome, Adansonia madagascariensis and A. rubrostipa occur specifically in the Anjajavy Forest, sometimes growing out of the tsingy limestone itself. A. digitata has been called \"a defining icon of African bushland\".\n",

    "Species": "Species include:\nAdansonia digitata L. – African baobab, dead-rat-tree, monkey-bread-tree (western, northeastern, central & southern Africa, in Oman and Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula, Asia and in Penang, Malaysia)\nAdansonia grandidieri Baill. – Grandidier's baobab, giant baobab (Madagascar)\nAdansonia gregorii F.Muell. (syn. A. gibbosa) – boab, Australian baobab, bottletree, cream-of-tartar-tree, gouty-stem (northwestern Australia)\nAdansonia kilima Pettigrew, et al. – montane African baobab (eastern & southern Africa)\nAdansonia madagascariensis Baill. – Madagascar baobab (Madagascar)\nAdansonia perrieri Capuron – Perrier's baobab (northern Madagascar)\nAdansonia rubrostipa Jum. & H.Perrier (syn. A. fony) – fony baobab (Madagascar)\nAdansonia suarezensis H.Perrier – Suarez baobab (Madagascar)\nAdansonia za Baill. – za baobab (Madagascar)\n",
    "Uses": "Some baobab species are sources of fiber, dye, and fuel. Indigenous Australians used the native species A. gregorii for several products, making string from the root fibers and decorative crafts from the fruits.\nA large, hollow baobab south of Derby, Western Australia, is said to have been used in the 1890s as a prison for convicts on their way to Derby for sentencing. The Boab Prison Tree, Derby still stands and is now a tourist attraction. Although the boabab tree near Derby might not have been used as a prison, a similar hollow boabab tree near Wyndham Australia actually was.\n",
    "Water storage": "Baobabs store water in the trunk (up to 100,000 litres or 26,000 US gallons) to endure harsh drought conditions. All occur in seasonally arid areas, and are deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season.\n"
