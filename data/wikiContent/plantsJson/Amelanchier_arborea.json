    "Cultivation": "This species tolerates varying light levels, but is at its best in full sun. It requires good drainage and air circulation and should be watered during drought. It is often confused with other species in the nursery trade. Propagation is by seed, divisions and grafting.\nThe fruit is drier than some other serviceberries, and it is harvested locally for pies and jams; they were also used by Native Americans to make bread.\n",
