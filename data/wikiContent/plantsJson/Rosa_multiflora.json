    "Cultivation and uses": "Rosa multiflora is grown as an ornamental plant, and also used as a rootstock for grafted ornamental rose cultivars.\nIn eastern North America, Rosa multiflora is now generally considered an invasive species, though it was originally introduced from Asia as a soil conservation measure, as a natural hedge to border grazing land, and to attract wildlife. It is readily distinguished from American native roses by its large inflorescences, which bear multiple flowers and hips, often more than a dozen, while the American species bear only one or a few on a branch.\nSome places classify Rosa multiflora as a \"noxious weed\". In grazing areas, this rose is generally considered to be a serious pest, though it is considered excellent fodder for goats.\n",
    "Management": "The targeted removal of multiflora rose often requires an aggressive technique, such as the full removal of the plant in addition to the root structure. Pruning and cutting back of the plant often leads to re-sprouting. Two natural biological controls include the rose rosette disease and the rose seed chalid (Megastigmus aculeastus var. nigroflavus). Patches of introduce multiflora rose in Pennsylvania are displaying symptoms of rose rosette disease, which can lead to decline and death.\n",
