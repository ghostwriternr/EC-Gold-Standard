    "Cultivation": "Several species are grown as ornamental plants in gardens. One species, Polystichum tsus-simense of eastern Asia, is commonly offered as a houseplant.\n",
    "Description": "Many ferns of this genus have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of evergreen fronds 30 to 200 centimetres (10 to 80 in) long. The sori are round, with a circular indusium. The stipes have prominent scales. The genus differs from the well-known and allied fern genus Dryopteris in the indusium being circular, not reniform, and in having the leaf blades with asymmetrical segments—one side of the segment is much longer than the other at the base.\n",
    "Ecology": "Polystichum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Pharmacis fusconebulosa. Specimens of some of these can be found at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney.\n",
    "Former species": "Species that were at one time considered part of the Polystichum genus, but are now categorized elsewhere, include:\nPolystichum auriculatum (L.) C.Presl 1836 = Dryopteris auriculata (L.) Kuntze 1891\nPolystichum falcatum (L.f.) Diels 1899 = Cyrtomium falcatum (L.f.) C.Presl – Japanese Holly Fern\nPolystichum lepidocaulon (Hook.) J.Sm. 1866 = Cyrtomidictyum lepidocaulon (Hook.) Ching 1940\n",

    "Selected species": "The genus Polystichum includes, but is not limited to, the following species. In this list, a species name preceded by (=) is considered to be a synonym of the accepted species name above it.\n"
