    "Uses": "Land cress is considered a satisfactory substitute for watercress. It can be used in sandwiches, or salads, or cooked like spinach, or used in soup and fish.\nLand cress can be grown easily in any garden. Like watercress, it loves water, but does not do well when partially submerged for long periods of time. This perennial needs full sun and frequent watering in any garden, unless near a direct source of water.\nOther common names include dryland cress, cassabully, and American watercress. A variegated form is available.\n"
